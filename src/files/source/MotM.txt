Outside the gloryof Arvandor, their favorite place was the Feywild-arealm of unbrid led passion . It was to that place ofsplendors that elves fled after they were exi led fromCorel Ion's presence for plotting with their god's rival ,Lolth. And it was there that they transformed fromFey creatures into Humanoids and lost their ability tosha pe -s hift at will. Afterward, they often wept as theyrealized what they had lost, their sorrow made evendeeper by the Fe ywil d's influence. But in the Fe ywil d,they also discovered the potential joys of being peopleof fi xe d forms , and they rediscovered hope once theyrenounced Lolth 's treacher y.Most elves eventua lly spread from the Feywild toother worlds, as wanderlust and curiosity drove themto the far reaches of the multiverse. In those otherworlds, elves developed the physical forms now as-sociated with them . Because of their original mutablenature, each group of elves mystically took on charac-teristics of the environment with which they bonded,whether forests (wood elves), fey crossings in theMaterial Plane (high elves), the Underdar k (drow),the Shadowfell (shadar-kai), the Fe yw ild (eladrin), oroceans (sea elves).In some places , Corellon has passed from elves 'memory, but the god 's blood flows within them still,even if they know nothing of its source. That blood iswhat causes them to evolve after spending centuriesconnected to a particular environment, so it is only amatter of time before other kinds of elves emerge.Darkvision.

Thechapter includes old favorites from past edi-tions of the game as well as creatures created forthe current edition.This chapter is a companion to the Monster Man-ual and adopts a simi lar presentation. If you are un-familiar with the monster stat block format, read theintroduction of the Monster Manual before proceed -ing further. It explains stat block terminology andgives rules for various monster traits - informationthat isn't repeated here.The creatures in this bestiary are organized alpha-betically. A few are gathered under a group heading;for example, the "Dinosaurs" section contains statblocks for various dinosaurs .Herein you will find some weapons that deal un-usual damage types and spellcasting that functionsin atypical ways. Such an exception is a specialfeature of a monster and represents how it usesthe weapon or casts its spells; the exception hasno affect on how a weapon or a spell functions forsomeone else.Finally, if a stat block contains the name of a classin the monster's name or in parentheses under thename, the monster is considered a member of thatclass for the purpose of meeting prerequisites formagic items.CHAPTER 2 I BESTIARY 37ABISHAISEach abishai was once a mortal whosomehow won Tiamat's favor beforedeath and, as a reward, fo und its sou ltransformed into a draconic devil to serveat her pleasure in the Nine Hells. Eachtype of abishai is associated with one ofTiamat's five dragon heads: black, blue,green , red , and white.Tiamat deploys abishais as her agents,sending them forth to represent herinterests in the Hells and across the mul -tiverse. Some have simple tasks, such asdelivering a message to cultists . Othershave greater responsibilities, such asleading large groups , assassinating tar-gets, and serving in armies. In all cases,abishais are fanatically loyal to Tiamat ,ready to lay down their lives if needed.Abishais stand outside the normal hierarchy ofthe Nine Hells, having their own chain of commandand ultimately answering to Tiamat (and Asmodeus ,when he chooses to use them). Other archdevils cancommand abishais to work for them, but most arch -devils do so rarely, since it is never clear whetheran abishai follows Tiamat's orders or Asmodeus's.There is inherent risk in counte r manding an ordergiven by Tiamat , but interfering with Asmodeus'splans invites certain destruction.BLACK ABISHAIMedium Fiend (Devi l), Typically Lawful EvilArmor Class 15 (natural armor)Hit Points 58 (9d8 + 18)Speed 30 ft ., fl y 40 ft.STR14 (+ 2)DEX17 (+ 3)CON14 (+2)Saving Throws Dex +6, Wis +6Skills Perception +6, Stealth +6INT13 (+l)WIS16 (+ 3)CHA11 (+ 0)Damage Resistances co ld; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashingfrom nonmagical attac ks that aren 't sil veredDamage Immunities acid , fire, poisonCondition Immunities poisonedSenses darkvision 120 ft. , passive Perception 16Languages Draconic, Infernal, telepathy 120 ft.Challenge 7 (2 ,900 XP) Proficiency Bonus +3Dev il' s Sight.

Th e road to lichdom offers an alternative wayto e scap e the perman ency of de ath , but that path islong an d fraught with barri e rs . Alhoons are mindfl aye rs who have us ed a shortcut to a ttain a lich-like sta te.Elder brains forbid mind flaye rs from pursuingmagic power aside from psionics, but it isn't an in-terdiction th ey must often enforce. Illithids brook nomast e rs but members of th eir own kind , so it isn 'tin their nature to bow to any god or oth erworldlypatron . However, wizardr y re mains a temptation. Inth e pages of a spellbook , an illithid s ee s a system toacquire authority. Through th e writing s of the wiz-ard who pe nned it, the illithid perceives the work-ings of a highly intelligent mind. Most mind flayerswho find a spellbook react with a bhorrence or indif-ference, but for some, a sp ellbook is a gateway to anew way of thinking.For a time , the study of su ch forbidden te xts canbe hidden from other illithids and even from anelder brain. Yet eventually, mind flayer arcanistsdete rmined to pursue wizardry must flee the colonyfor their own safety. Once th ey ta ste fr ee dom fromthe colony, some prize th eir privacy, others seek toc ommune with similar minds , and still others se ekto dominate a colony by elevating themselves to th eposition of leadership normally held by an elderbrain. Regardless, all such ar c anists face the samestark fact: when they die, th ey will not join the hostof minds in the elder brain - deviant minds are neverac cepted as part of th e collective. For them, deathme ans oblivion.Lic hdom offers sal vation and th e prospect of beingable to pursue knowledge indefinitely. Yet learningth e s e cr et of achieving lichdom re quir es an arcanespellc aster to be at the apex of pow er- a significantchallenge for mind flayers , given the scarcity ofavailable me ntors and training.Confronting this reality, a group of nine mindflayer ar c anists used their ar c an e magic and psion-ics to weave a new truth . Th e se nin e called them-se lv es the Alhoon, and thos e who follow in th eirfoo t steps are referred to by the same name.4 2 C H A PT E R 2 I BESTIARYCOLLABORATIVE UNDEATHTo become alhoons, mind flayer ar c anists must co-operat e in the creation of a periapt of mind trapping ,a fist-sized container made of silve r, emerald, andam ethyst. The process re quir es at least three mindflayer ar c anists and th e sa crifice of an equal numberof souls from living victims in a three-day-long ritualof sp ellc asting and psionic communion. Upon itscompletion, free-willed undeath is conferred on themind flayers , turning th em into alhoons.Initially, an alhoon can be difficult to distinguishfrom a normal mind flayer. Th e most obvious dif-fere nce is the lack of a mind flayer's ever-presentmucus coating. Without that prot ection, an alhoon 'sskin be c omes dry and cra cked, and its eyes mightappear shriveled and sunken. Both of these cluesare easily missed by someone who hasn 't seen amind flayer. However, in short ord er, an alhoon 'sfl e sh with e rs away and its empty eye sockets gleamwith cold pinpricks of light like thos e of other liches.Unlike a true lich's phylactery, th e periapt of mindtrapping doesn't restor e the alhoons to undeath ifth ey are destroyed. Inst ead, a destroy ed alhoon'smind is transferred to th e periapt, where it remainsin communion with any other trapp ed alhoonminds , as well as the soul s of those sacrificed.Th e undeath conferr ed by a p eriapt of mind trap-ping lasts only so long as the life of the living victimselecte d. Thus an alhoon who sa crificed a 200-year-old elf looks forward to a much longer existencethan one that sacrificed a 35-year-old person. Al-hoons can extend their existence by repeating theritual with new victims, effective ly re setting thecloc ks for themselves.Destroying a periapt of mind trapping consignsthos e trapped within it to oblivion, and thus alhoon soften work together to cr e at e elaborate protectionsfor their periapt and th eir pr efe rr ed ritual site.Sometimes a single alhoon is entrust ed with thep eriapt of mind trapping, but this is a dangerousproposition. Anyone who holds th e periapt gainsadvantage on attacks, saving throws, and checksagainst the alhoons associat ed with its creation,and thos e alhoons in turn suffer disadvantage on at-tacks , saving throws , and che cks against the holde r.In addition, the holder can telepathically commu-nicate with any sacrificed soul trapped within, andalhoons within the periapt c an speak telepathicallywith the holder. A creatur e carr ying the periaptcan 't prevent communication from alhoons but cansilence trapped souls.ALHOONMedium Undead (Mind Flayer, Wizard), Typically Neutral EvilArmor Class 15 (natural armor)Hit Points 150 (20d8 + 60)Speed 30 ft., fly 15 ft.

These dripping infestationsconceal the demonic nature of the alkilith, makingwhat should be a dire warning appear strange butotherwise innocuous. Wherever alkiliths take root,they weaken the fabric of reality, creating a portalthrough which even nastier demons can invade.The appearance of an alkilith in the world heraldsa great wrongness and an imminent catastrophe.An alk ilith searches for an aperture such as a win-dow or a door around which it can take root, stretch-ing its body around the opening and anchoring itselfwith a sticky secretion. If left undisturbed, the open-ing becomes attuned to the Abyss and eventua ll ybecomes a portal to that plane (see "Planar Portals"in the Dungeon Master's Guide).Alkiliths spring from cast-off bits of the hideous,shuddering body ofJuiblex (appears in this book).They gradually become self-aware and seek to findtheir way onto the Material Plane. Since most cult-ists consider them too risky to summon - they can,after all, create portals to the Abyss- alkiliths mustfind other escape routes out of their native plane.44 CHAPTER 2 I BESTIARYMedium Fiend (Demon), Typically Chaotic EvilArmor Class 17 (natural armor)Hit Points 168 (l6d8 + 96)Speed 40 ft. , climb 40 ft.STR12 (+ l)DEX19 (+4)CON22 (+6 )Saving Throws Dex+8, Con +10Skills Stealth +8INT6 (-2)WISll (+0)CHA7 (- 2)Damage Resistances acid, cold , fire, lightning; blud geon ing,piercing, and sl ash ing from nonmagica l atta ck sDamage Immunities poisonConditi on Immun iti es ch armed , fr ighten ed, poisonedSenses darkvision 120 ft ., passive Perception 10Languag es understan ds Ab yssa l but can' t speakChallenge ll (7 ,200 XP ) Profi ci en cy Bonus +4Abyssal Rift.

Secrets protectedin this manner range in scope from a demon lord'strue name to the hidden truths of the cosmic order.The creature acq uir es the secret, but the curse an -nihilates its body and leaves behind a spectra l beingcomposed of fragments from the victim's psycheand overwhel ming psychic agon y.Every allip is wracked with a horrifying insightthat torments what remains of its mind. In the pres-ence of other creat ures, an allip seeks to relieve thisburden by sharing its secret. The creature can im -part only a shard of the knowledge that doomed it,but that piece is eno ugh to wrack the recipient withtemporary mental a nguish and viol ent compulsions.The survivors of an a ll ip's attack are sometimesleft with a compulsion to learn more about whatspawned this monstrosity. Strange phrases echothrough their minds, and weird visions occupy theirdreams. The sense that some colossa l truth sits ju stoutside their recall plagues them for days, months,and sometimes years after their fateful encounter.INSIDIOUS LOREAn allip might attempt to share its lore to escape itscurse and enter the afterlife. It can transfer knowl-edge from its mind by guiding another creatu re towr ite down what it knows. This process takes daysor possibly weeks. An allip can accomplish this taskby lurking in the study or workplace of a scho lar. Ifthe allip remains hidden, its victim is gradually over-come by frantic energy. A scholar, driven by suddeninsigh ts to work night and day, produces reams oftext with little memory of exactly what the docu-ments contain. If the allip su cceeds, it passes fro mthe worl d-and its terrib le secret hides somewherein the scho l ar's text, waiting to be discovered by itsnext victim.ALLIPMedium Undead , Typ ically Neutral Ev ilArmor Class 13Hit Points 40 (9d8)Speed Oft., fly 40 ft .

They collect the souls arriving in theform of lemures (see the Monster Manual). Lemureshave no personalities or memories; they're drivenonly by the desire to commit evil. The amnizus thatpatrol here drill the rules of the Nine Hells into thenew arrivals' minds and marshal them into legions.VARIANT : D EVI L SUMMONINGSome amnizus have an action that allows them tosummon other devils:Summon Devil (1/Day). The amnizu summons 2d4 beardeddevils or ld4 barbed devils (both appear in the Monster Man-ual). A summoned devil appears in an unoccupied space within60 feet of the amnizu, acts as an ally of the amnizu, and can 'tsummon other devils. It remains for l minute , until the amnizudies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.Blinding Rot. The amnizu targets one or two creatures that itcan see within 60 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC19 Wisdom saving throw or take 26 (4dl2) necrotic damage andbe blinded until the start of the amnizu 's next turn.Forgetfulness (Recharge 6). The amnizu targets one creatureit can see within 60 feet of it. That creature must succeed ona DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or take 26 (4dl2) psychicdamage and become stunned for l minute . A stunned creaturerepeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, endingthe effect on itself on a success. If the target is stunned for thefull minute , it forgets everything it sensed , experienced, andlearned during the last 5 hours.Spellcasting. The amnizu casts one of the following spells , re-quiring no material components and using Intelligence as thespellcasting ability (spell save DC 19):At will: command3/day: dominate monsterl /day: feeblemindREACTIONSInstinctive Charm. When a creature within 60 feet of the am-nizu makes an attack roll against it , and another creature iswithin the attack's range , the attacker must make a DC 19Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker musttarget the creature that is closest to it, not including the am-nizu or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attackerchooses which one to target. If the saving throw is successful,the attacker is immune to the amnizu 's Instinctive Charmfor 24 hours.ANNIS HAGAnnis hags lair in mountains or hills. These hunch-backed and hump-shouldered hags are the largestand most physically imposing of their kind, standingeight feet tall. They can easily tear a fully grownperson apart, but they love hunting the young, pre-ferring their flesh above all others.Annis hags leave tokens of their cruelty at theedges of forests and other areas they claim to pro-voke fear and distrust in nearby villages and set-tlements. To an annis hag, nothing is sweeter thanmaking a once-vibrant community paralyzed withterror, so folk never venture out at night, strangersare met with suspicion and anger, and parents warntheir children: "Be good, or the annis will get you."When an annis feels especially cruel, the hagadopts the appearance of a kindly elder, approachesa child in a remote place, and gives them an iron to-ken (described below), through which the child canmagically confide in the hag. Over time, "Granny"or "Grampy" convinces the child that it's okay to dobad deeds-starting with breaking things or wan-dering without permission, then graduating to push-ing someone down the stairs or setting a house onfire. Eventually, the child's terrified family and com-munity face painful decisions of what to do aboutthe seemingly remorseless child.Much as annis hags befriend children in orderto corrupt them, they may adopt a group of ogres,trolls, or other creatures (ogres and trolls appearin the Monster Manual), ruling them through brutestrength, insults, and superstition .IRON TOKENAn annis hag can pull out one of their iron teeth ornails and spend 1 minute shaping and polishingit into the form of a coin, a ring, or a tiny mirror.Thereafter, any creature that holds this iron tokencan have a whispered conversation with the hag,provided the creature and the hag are within 10miles of each other. When the hag speaks throughthe token, the holder can hear the hag's whisper butnot any other sounds at the hag's location. Similarly,the hag can hear the holder of the token but not thenoise around it.A hag can have up to three iron tokens active atone time. As an action, the hag can discern thedirection and approximate distance to those activetokens. The hag can deactivate any of those tokensat any distance (no action required), whereupon thetoken retains its current form but loses its magic.HAG COVENSAn annis hag that is part of a coven (see the "HagCovens" sidebar in the Monster Manual) has a chal-lenge rating of 8 (3,900 XP).Large Fey, Typically Chaotic EvilArmor Class 17 (natural armor)Hit Points 90 (l2dl0 + 24)Speed 40 ft.STR21 (+5)DEX12 (+l)Saving Throws Con +5CON14 (+2)INT73 (+ l)Skills Deception +5, Perception +5Damage Resistances coldWIS14 (+2)Senses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 15Languages Common, Giant, SylvanCHA15 (+2)Challenge 6 (2,300 XP) Proficiency Bonus +3ACTIONSMultiattack.

One of these battles pitted the le-gions of the archdevil Glasya against the screaminghordes of the demon lord Graz'zt (appears in thisbook). It is said that when Glasya wounded Graz'ztwith her sword, the first babaus arose where hisblood struck the ground. Their sudden appearancehelped rout Glasya and secured Graz'zt's place asone of the preeminent demon lords of the Abyss.A babau demon has the cunning of a devil and thebloodthirstiness of a demon.

Duke Bael, oneof Mammon's most important vassals, has wonfame and acclaim for his victories. Charged withleading sixty-six companies of barbed devils (see theMonster Manual), Bae) has proven to be a tacticalgenius, earning esteem for himself and his masteras a result of victory after victory over the abyssalhost. Mammon relies on Bael to safeguard his hold-ings because of Bael's battle acumen. During a timewhen so many other archdevils have lost their posi-tions, Mammon has never been ousted, which is atestament to Bael's skill on the battlefield.For his accomplishments, Bael has been grantedthe title of Bronze General. His accolades notwith-standing, he has had a difficult time navigating thequagmire of infernal politics. His critics call himnaive, though never to his face. His primary interesthas always been leading soldiers in battle, so hefinds it frustrating to have his ambitions of ascend-ing to a higher rank constantly stymied by politicallyshrewd rivals .Bae! prefers to make servants out of his adver-saries, and mortals bound to his service earn theirwretched place by falling victim to his superior strat-agems. Bae) gladly spares the lives of those he de-feats-if they pledge their souls and service to him.Demons are an exception; although he is willing tocorrupt almost any other foes, he always destroysdemons he defeats.Bael also welcomes mortals into his service if theycan provide him with an advantage in his politick-ing. He recruits savvy individuals and relies on themto represent his interests at Mammon's court, whichleaves him free to pursue his battle lust.Despite his lack of interest in affairs outsidebattle, or perhaps because of it, Bae) has gained asmall following of cultists.

It then warps reality around itself, hiding it-self and remaking its environment to resemble sucha place. The imitation is imperfect, but it's goodenough to fool greedy or desperate creatures.

He is worshiped by those whowant to break the confines of civility and unleashtheir bestial natures, for Baphomet envisions aworld without restraint, where creatures live outtheir most bloodthirsty desires.Cults devoted to Baphomet use mazes and com-plex knots as their emblems. They create secretplaces to indulge themselves, including labyrinthsof the sort their master favors. Bloodstained crownsand weapons of iron and brass decorate their pro-fane altars.Over time, a cultist of Baphomet becomes taintedby his influence, gaining bloodshot eyes and coarse,thickening hair. Small horns eventually sprout fromthe cultist's forehead. In time, a devoted cultistmight transform entirely into a minotaur, which isconsidered the greatest gift of the Prince of Beasts.Baphomet appears as a fearsome, 20-foot-tall mi-notaur with six iron horns. A fiendish light burns inhis red eyes. Although he is filled with bestial bloodlust, there lies within him a cruel and cunning intel-lect devoted to subverting all civilization.Baphomet wields a great glaive called Heart-cleaver. He also charges his enemies and goresthem with his horns, trampling his foes into theearth and rending them with his teeth like a beast.BAPHOMET'S LAIRBaphomet's lair is his palace, the Lyktion, which ison the layer of the Abyss called the Endless Maze.Nestled within the twisting passages of the plane-wide labyrinth, the Lyktion is immaculately main-tained and surrounded by a moat constructed in thefashion of a three-dimensional maze.

Any creatures or objectsin the room when this happens fall in the directionof the new pull of gravity, unless they have somemeans of remaining aloft. Baphomet can ignorethe gravity reversal if he's in the room , althoughhe likes to use this action to land on a ceiling toattack targets flying near it.Seal the Way. Baphomet seals one doorway orother entryway within the lair. The opening mustbe unoccupied. It is filled with solid stone for1 minute or until Baphomet takes this lair ac-tion again.REGIONAL EFFECTSThe region containing Baphomet's lair is warpedby his magic, creating one or more of the follow-ing effects:Beguiling Realm.

Obsessed withgathering secrets, both from the gods they inhabitand from the bones of dead creatures, they ca ll forththe spirits of the dead and force them to divulgewhat they learned in life.Berbalangs prefer to speak only to dead things,and specifically only to the sp i rits they call forth inthe hope of learning secrets. They record their sto-ries on the bones that once be longed to these crea-tures, thus preserving the information they gain.Pursuit of knowledge drives everything berbal-angs do. Although they mostly learn their secretsfrom the dead, they aren't above spying on the livingto take knowledge from them as well. A berbalangcan create a spectral duplicate of itself and sendthe duplicate out to gather information on otherplanes by watching places where the gods and theirservants gather. When a berbalang is perceiving itsenvironment through its duplicate, its actual body isunconscious and can't protect itself. Thus , a berbal -ang typically uses its duplicate for only a short timebefore returning its consciousness to its body.The knowledge that berbalangs accumulatemakes them great sources of information for pow-erful people traveling the planes. Berbalangs ignorepetitioners, however, u nless they come bearing achoice secret or the bones of a particularly inter-esting creat ure.

The hag's hair is white,and the hag is emaciated, with pale eyes surroundedby bruise-colored flesh. A bheur hag carries atwisted gray wooden staff that can be ridden like aflying broom and that augments the hag's magic.Bheur hags are attracted to selfish actions in-spired by deadly cold, such as murdering a travelerfor a winter coat or chopping down a dryad's grovefor firewood. These actions are especially sweet toa bheur if they are unwarranted, such as a greedymerchant hoarding excess food for the winter whileothers starve. Bheurs use their ability to manipulateweather to batter villages with freezing cold, hopingto instill a despair that turns folk against each other.In combat , a bheur hag also strives to inspirehorror.

Devoid of lifeand soul, it exists only to cause death.A worshiper of Orcus can take ritual vows whilecarving the demon lord's symbol on their chestover the heart. Orcus's power flays body, mind, andsoul, leaving behind a sentient husk that consumeslife energy near it. Most bodaks come into being inthis way, then are unleashed to spread death in Or-cus's name.Bodaks are extensions of Orcus's will outside theAbyss, serving the demon prince's aims and otherminions. Orcus can recall anything a bodak sees orhears. If he so chooses, he can speak through a bo-dak to address his enemies and followers directly.A bodak retains vague impressions of its past life.It seeks out its former allies and enemies alike todestroy them, as its warped soul seeks to erase any-thing connected to its former life. Minions of Orcusare the one exception to this compulsion; a bodakrecognizes them as kindred souls and spares themfrom its wrath . Anyone who knew the individualbefore its transformation into a bodak can recog-nize mannerisms or other subtle clues to its origi-nal identity.CHAPTER 2 I BESTIARYBODAKMed ium Un dead, Typically Chaotic EvilArmor Class 15 (natural armor)Hit Points 58 (9d8 + 18)Speed 30 ft .STR15 (+2)DEX16 (+3)CON15 (+2)Skills Perception +4, Stealth +6INT7 (-2)WIS12 (+l)CHA12 (+l)Damage Resistances cold, fire; bludgeon ing, piercing , andslashing from nonmagical attacksDamage Immunities necrotic , poisonCondition Immunities charmed, frightened , poisonedSenses darkvision 120 ft ., pas s ive Perception 14Languages Abyssal , the languages it knew in lifeChallenge 6 (2 , 300 XP) Proficiency Bonus +3Death Gaze.

For example, a forsaken childmight unintentionally conjure a boggle and seethem as a sort of imaginary friend. A boggle mightalso appear in the attic of a lonely widower's houseor in a hermit's cave.Boggles engage in petty pranks to amuse them-selves, using the oil they excrete to ca use trouble.A boggle also isn't above breaking dishes, hidingtools, startling cows to decreas e their milk, or hid-ing a baby in an attic. Although a boggle's anticsmight cause distress and unintentional harm, mis -chief- not mayhem-is usually the intent. If threat -ened, a boggle flees rather than stand and fight.A boggle can create magical openings to travelshort distances or to pilfer items that would other-wise be beyond its reach. To create such a rift inspace, a boggle must be adjacent to a space definedby a frame, such as an open window or a doorway,a gap betw ee n the bars of a cage, or the openingbetw ee n the feet of a bed and the floor. The rift isinvisible and disappears after a few seconds- justenough time for the boggle to step, reach, or attackthrough it.CHAPTER 2 I BEST I A RY 65BONECLAWA wizard who tries to become a lich but fails mightbecome a boneclaw instead. These hideous, cack-ling monsters share a few of liches' attributes, butwhile liches are immortal masters of the arcane,boneclaws are thralls to evil, hatred, and pain.The most important part of the transformationritual occurs when the soul of the aspiring lichmigrates to a prepared phylactery. If the wizardis too physically or magically weak to compel thesoul into its new home, the soul instead seeks outa master - a person within a few miles who has ahate-filled heart. The soul bonds to that person andbecomes enslaved to its new master's wishes. Theboneclaw forms near its master, sometimes appear-ing before that individual to receive orders and othertimes simply seeking to fulfill its master's desires.A boneclaw can serve only an evil creature. If itsmaster finds redemption or sincerely turns awayfrom the path of evil, the boneclaw is destroyed.Otherwise, a boneclaw can't be destroyed while itsmaster lives. No matter what happens to the bone-claw's body, it re-forms within hours.In service to its master, a boneclaw delights incausing horrific pain. It lurks like a spider in shad-owy recesses, waiting for victims to approach withinreach of its long, bony limbs.

When prey blundersinto the filament, the cave fisher reels in its meal. Agroup of cave fishers might work together to covera large area with filaments , but as soon as one cap -tures potential food, every cave fisher in the areacompetes for the prize. If a victim escapes from theinitial ambush , a cave fisher can reclaim its prey byshooting a filament out to capture it again .Scarce food might draw a group of cave fishers upto the surface, into a shadowy canyon or a gloomyforest that features both native animal prey andcreatures such as explorers or travelers occasion-ally moving through the area .VALUABLE PARTSNearly every part of a cave fisher is useful after thecreature has been dispatched. Cave fisher filamentscan be woven into rope that is thin , tough, andnearly invisible. The creature 's shell is used in themanufacture of tools, armor, and jewelry. Its bloodis alcoholic and tastes like strong liquor. Severaldwarven spirits include cave fisher blood, and somedwarves , especially berserkers , drink the bloodstraight. Cave fisher meat is edible, tasting muchlike crab cooked in strong wine.While some folk hunt cave fishers to kill them toharvest their filaments, shells, and blood, otherscapture cave fisher eggs and rear the hatchlings,which can be tra i ned to guard passages or serve asbeasts of war. Cave fishers have a natural aversionto fire, since their blood is flammable .

Most live in colonies in theUnderdark and fight the enemies ofthe Demon Queen of Spiders . Longago, the cult of Lolth first subjectedelf prisoners to horrible rituals thattransformed them into creatureswith both elven and spider traits,which their creators dubbed chitines.The intention was to create servilewarriors dedicated first to the cultand then, only by association with it,to Lolth. The goddess found this ar-rangement unacceptable.As punishment, the Spider Queen twisted herworshipers' rituals. The process usually trans -formed subjects into the spindly creatures herdevotees expected, but occasionally, an elf changedinto a choldrith (appears in this book): an arachnidMonstrosity able to command and create morechitines on its own. These choldriths soon led thechitines to rebel and abandon their creators, found-ing free colonies elsewhere in the Underdark. Onoccasion, though, colonies can be found in remote,gloomy areas of the surface world, warring againstLolth's enemies.The cult of Lolth still creates chitines as the needarises. Outside the presence of a choldrith, chitinesmake good workers, and they can be useful if thecult finds an independent chitine colony and want toinfiltrate it. If the creation process yields a choldrith,though, the cult destroys the creature.As servants of Lolth, chitines love spiders. Theyrear spiders and similar arachnids, such as cavefishers (also in this book). Chitine colonies erectshrines to Lolth that serve as beacons, attractingspiders and other beings that serve her. Anywherechitines set up a colony quickly becomes a web-shrouded, gloomy, and treacherous place.Chitines resemble spiders, but they behave morelike social insects such as ants. They are dividedinto worker and warrior castes; choldriths, whenpresent, occupy the top levels of a colony's hierar-chy. Each chitine has a social position that comeswith duties related to that rank, and all are expectedto sacrifice themselves to protect the colony's chol-driths. Every chitine has spinnerets and slowlyproduces webbing that is used to build floors, walls,structures, objects, and traps that benefit the colony.A warrior might be responsible for crafting webarmor (which is as tough as hide or leather), whilea group of workers might be tasked to dig pit trapsand cover them with fragile webbing disguised withloose dirt to appear as a solid surface.CHITINESma ll Monstro sity, Typicall y Cha oti c EvilArmor Class 14 (h ide armor)Hit Points 18 (4d6 + 4)Speed 30 ft ., climb 30 ft.STR10 (+0)DEX14 (+ 2)CON12 (+l)Skills Athletics +4, Stealth +4INT10 (+0)WIS10 (+0)Senses darkvision 60 ft ., passive Perception l 0Languages UndercommonCHA7 (-2)Challenge 1/2 (100 XP) Proficiency Bonus +2Fey Ancestry.

This flexible internal structure enables themto easily slip into narrow fissures and niches inthe walls of their cavern homes. They lurk inthese spots , silent and unseen , waiting for prey tohappen by.A choker's usual method for luring prey involvespositioning the body of its latest catch just outsideits hiding spot. Whenever it gets hungry, it tearsoff a few chunks of flesh to feed itself. In the mean -time, the corpse serves to entice other curiousfolk-explorers from the surface world, drow, duer -gar, or the choker's favorite prey, goblins- to comewithin reach.When a target presents itself, the choker's star-fish-shap ed hands dart out of its hiding spot, wraparound the victim's throat, and pin the unfortunatecreature against the cavern wall. Because its armsare so long, the choker can keep its body deep in-side the crevice where it hides, beyond the reach ofmost normal weapons.Choke rs tend to set th eir ambushes alone, ratherthan working in concert, but where one choker isfound , others are likely to be n ea rby. They commu-nicate through eerie, k ee ning howls that travel longdistan ces through caves and tunnels but are difficultto identify or locate in a typical ec ho-filled cavern.76 CHAPTER '2 I BESTIARYCHOKERSmall Ab erration , Typically Cha oti c EvilArmor Class 16 (natural armor)Hit Points 13 (3d6 + 3)Speed 30 ft .STR16 (+3)DEX14 (+ 2)Skills Stealth +6CON13 (+ l)INT4 (-3)WIS12 (+l)Senses darkvision 60 ft ., passive Perceptio n l lLanguages Deep SpeechCHA7 (-2)Challenge l (100 XP) Proficiency Bonus +2Ab errant Quickne ss (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).

As a bonus action on laterturns, the choldrith can move the dagger up to 20 feet and reâ€¢peat the attack against one creature within 5 feet of the dagger.CHOLDRITHCholdriths are monstrous spiderlike creatures orig-inally created to serve Lolth. They rule colonies ofchitines (in this book) and lead them into battle inLolth's war against her enemies.When devotees of Lolth created the first chitines,she watched as her followers used arcane magicand demonic powers and invoked her aid for thedivine spark needed to ensure the subjects' survival,expecting to see these new abominations dedicatedsolely to her, but the devotees performed no such rit-ual. As revenge for the devotees' betrayal, the SpiderQueen manipulated the creation rituals so that theysometimes created choldriths instead of chitines.At first, these devotees were unaware that thenew creatures, which they dubbed choldriths, weresigns of Lolth's wrath. Instead, they were pleased,because choldriths could lay eggs that birthed morechitines (and the rare choldrith) and could directthe chitines in their work. But the devotees soon re-alized their mistake-choldriths belonged to Lolth,body and soul. Choldriths whispered to the chitinesof their adoration of the Spider Queen and theirenmity against their creators, and led them in a suc-cessful revolt.Choldriths are born with a mystical connectionto Lolth, which gives them divine magic. They alsomake up the ruling caste of most chitine colonies.A colony can support numerous choldriths, whoserve as commanders, priests, and supervisors. Thecholdriths continually jockey for position, althoughthey rarely confront one another in a way that putsthe colony at risk. The colony is ruled by a sover-eign, who determines which colony members per-form which tasks, including whether a choldrith ispermitted to lay eggs. Sometimes a choldrith rulerreceives a vision from Lolth that inspires the entirecolony into some grand, often violent, action.nH A PTFll ? I RF.~TT A llY ,.,,.,CLOCKWORKSGnomes' tinkering with magic and mechanical de-vices has produced many failed Constructs but alsohas resulted in genuine advances, such as clock-works. The methods used to craft clockworks havebeen shared between gnome communities overmany generations.BRONZE SCOUTA bronze scout seldom emerges from underground.Its telescoping eyestalks observe foes at close rangewhile most of its segmented body remains buried.If detected, it sends electrical shocks through theground toward pursuers while it retreats.IRON COBRAAn iron cobra is exactly what its name implies: ametal snake with a poisonous bite. Gnomes loadthis clockwork with alchemical concoctions that canparalyze creatures and cloud the mind.OAKEN BOLTERNo ordinary ballista, an oaken bolter is a Constructcapable of striking at long distances. The bolts itlaunches can rend flesh, destroy armor, or drag en-emies toward traps or melee-oriented clockworks-and at shorter ranges, burst with explosive force.STONE DEFENDERThe thick plates of stone riveted onto a stone de-fender give it substantial protection. Its chief role isas a bodyguard.INDIVIDUAL DESIGNSGnome artisans prefer unique clockworks overperfectly functioning ones that copy too much fromother creations. A clockwork can be customized byadding one of the following enhancements and onepotential malfunction to its stat block. You can se-lect randomly or choose a pair of modifications thatfit the temperament of the clockwork's builder.CLOCKWORK ENHANCEMENTSdl0 EnhancementCamouflaged.

In the Summer Queens ' wrath,she cursed every member of his house. The seeliefey's true name has been stricken from history, butthe stories call him Dubh Catha ("Dark Crow" inCommon), and other Fey refer to the house's descen-dants as dubh sith-"darklings." Darklings dwell insecluded caverns and chambers beneath the townsof other species. From such enclaves, they quietlyply their trade as thieves and assassins.DARKLINGThe Summer Queen 's curse causes a darkling 'sbody to absorb light, which wizens the creature,much like the effect of rapid aging. For this reason,darklings cover their entire bodies with clothingwhen exposure to light is a risk. The light darklingsabsorb over the course of their lives explodes out-ward when they die, incinerating the creatures andmuch of their possessions.DARKLING ELDERA wise and respected darkling can undergo a ritualto become an elder. Other elders mark the suppli-cant with glowing tattoos, channeling away some ofthe darkling's absorbed light. If the ritual succeeds,the darkling grows into a taller, elf-like form.

The consequences of breaking that pact can bedire and, in some cases, lethal. A warlock who failsto live up to a bargain with an evil patron runs therisk of rising from the dead as a deathlock, a foulUndead driven to serve its otherworldly patron.An powerful necromancer might also discover thewicked methods of creating a deathlock and thensubjugate it, acting as the deathlock's patron.DEATHLOCKAn overpowering urge to serve consumes the mindof a newly awakened deathlock. Any goals and am-bitions it had in life that don't please its patron fallaway as its master's desires become the purposethat drives it. The deathlock immediately resumeswork on its patron's behalf.Whatever the goal, it always reflects the patron'sinterests , ranging from small-scale concerns tomatters of cosmic scope. A deathlock in the thrall ofa Fiend might work to destroy a specific temple ded-icated to a good god, while one that serves a GreatOld One might hunt for the materials needed to callforth a horrifying entity into the world. To accom-plish a difficult goal, the deathlock might be forcedto serv e another powerful creature or might need togather servants of its own.86 CHAPTER 2 I BESTIARYâ€¢D EATHL O CK MASTERMINDThough deathlocks exist to serve their patrons , theyretain some freedom when it comes to devisingtactics and carrying out plans.

Hehas a saurian lower body and clawed, webbed feet;suckered tentacles sprout from the shoulders of hisgreat apelike torso, which is surmounted by two hid-eous simian heads named Aameul and Hathradiah.Their gaze brings bewilderment and confusion toany who confront them.Similarly, the spiraling Y sign of Demogorgon'scult drives those who contemplate it for too long todelirium. As a result, all followers of the Prince ofDemons break with reality sooner or later.DEMOGORGON'S LAIRDemogorgon makes his lair in a palace calledAbysm , found on a layer of the Abyss known as t heGaping Maw.

Th e firs t time acr ea tur e or a n obj ect int erac ts physica lly with De-mogorgon (for exa mple, by hitting him with an a t-tac k) , there is a 50 percent cha nce that the illusoryduplicate is affected, not Demogorgon , in whichca se the illusion disapp ea rs.CHAPTER 2 I BESTIARY 89REGIONAL EFFECTSThe region containing Demogorgon's lair is warpedby his magic, creating one or more of the follow-ing effects:Beguiling Realm.

A lone derromay seem pitiable, but a cackling, spit-ting, growling, howling horde of themis horrifying to behold.Fractious in groups and individu-ally weak, derro would have died outlong ago but for two elements of theircharacter. They are cautious and distrustful, whichserves them well as they navigate the dangers ofthe Underdark and its societies. They also have astronger-than-normal tendency to develop sorcerouspower. Individuals who do so usually serve as lead-ers and are known as savants.Grandiose fantasies and rampant fanaticism haveobscured derro 's true origin, even among them-selves. Most dwarves don't recognize derro as kin,but the legends that derro tell about their people andthe story that duergar believe share a grain of truth.According to the histories of some duergar, derroare descended from a dwarven community thatwas left behind when the others escaped the ruleof mind flayers. These remnants were so distortedby the mind flayers' psionic power that the dwarvesbecame Aberrations.Derro tell their own stories of flight and survivalin the Underdark, in which mind flayers aren't al-ways the enemy. They tell of two brothers, the godsDiirinka and Diinkarazan, and of how Diirinka clev-erly betrayed his sibling so that he could steal mag-ical power from the evil they escaped. The dangerthe brothers are said to face in this legend varies,depending on whatever foe the savants want to leadtheir people against, yet the essence of the storyremains the same: a lesson of survival at any priceand an example of how deceitfulness and crueltycan be virtues.DERROSmall Ab erra ti on, Typicall y Chaoti c Evi lArmor Class 13 (leather armor)Hit Points 13 (3d6 + 3)Speed 30 ft.STR10 (+ O)DEX14 (+2)Skills Stealth +4CON12 (+l)INT11 (+0)WIS5 (- 3)Senses darkvision 120 ft. , passive Perception 7Languages Dwarv ish , Und ercommonCHA9 (- 1)Challenge 1/4 (S O XP ) Proficiency Bonus +2Magic Resistance.

ICHAPTER 2 I BESTIARY 97DRAEGLOTHA draegloth is a demon created by an elf priest ofLolth in an unholy, dangerous ritual in which it isinfused with the fey essence of the creator and thefiendish essence of a glabrezu. This ritual rarelysucceeds, but Lolth's faithful consider it worth therisk, as the resulting creature is gifted with innatemagic and physical might. The draegloth usuallyserves its creator, lending its thirst for destruction tothe creator's plans to triumph over rivals.A draegloth is an ogre-sized, four-armed bipedwith purple skin and pale hair. Two of its arms aremuscular, tipped with sharp claws; the other twoare the size and shape of an elf's arms, capable ofdelicate movements. Although the creature is heav-ily muscled, it is graceful like an elf. Its bestial facefeatures glowing red eyes, a doglike snout, and amouth full of sharp teeth.Among the drow noble houses of Menzoberranzanin the Forgotten Realms, a high priestess's success-ful creation of a draegloth is seen as a sign of Lolth'sfavor toward her house-and a sign of the demonlord's disregard for the family's rivals, who were notthus gifted. The creation prompts the leaders of thehouse to begin crafting new plans to strike at its ri-vals when the draegloth is fully grown. These plansuse the draegloth in a significant role, because itsabilities can turn the tide in a battle against a housethat doesn't have a draegloth of its own.Although draegloths plays an important part inthe plans of Lolth's cult, a draegloth can't rise abovethe status of a favored servant to a priest in that cult.Before a draegloth is given any duties, it receives in-struction in accepting the role set for it and not chal-lenging authority. Most draegloths fiercely resentbeing given orders, but thanks to their training, theytypically take out their frustration on their creator'senemies, rather than on their creator. A draegloththat can't suppress its ambitions might abandon itscreator and strike out on its own. Whether theserebellious draegloths are part of Lolth's plan forsowing chaos is unclear.98 CHAPTER 2 I BESTIARYLarge Fiend (Demon), Typically Chaotic E~ilArmor Class 15 (natural armor)Hit Points 123 (l3dl0 + 52)Speed 30 ft.STR20 (+5)DEX15 (+2)CON18 (+4)Skills Perception +3, Stealth +5INT13 (+l)Damage Resistances cold , fire, lightningDamage Immunities poisonCondition Immunities po isonedWIS11 (+0)Senses darkvision 120 ft ., passive Perception 13Languages Abyssal , Elvish, UndercommonCHA11 (+0)Challenge 7 (2,900 XP) Proficiency Bonus +3Fey Ancestry.

It scrawls uponthe canvas of the creatures' minds, rewriting theirthoughts and authoring their dreams.An elder brain sustains itself by consuming thebrains of other creatures. If its mind flayer servantsdon't bring meals directly to it, the elder brainreaches out with tendrils of thought, compellingcreatures to come to it so that it can feed on them.When a mind flayer perishes, the elder brain'sservants feed its brain to their master, which thenabsorbs the knowledge and experience containedtherein. Mind flayers conceive of this oneness withthe elder brain as a sacred state akin to an afterlife.HIVE MINDElder brains are so-called among non-illithids be-cause they act as the central communication hub foran entire mind flayer colony, just as a brain does fora living body. Linked to the elder brain, the colonyacts like a single organism, acting in concert as ifeach illithid were the digit of a hand.An elder brain considers itself and its desiresthe most important things in the multiverse, andthe mind flayers in its colony nothing more thanextensions of its will. Each presides over its colonyaccording to its own unique personality and store-house of collected knowledge and experience. Someelder brains reign as tyrants , while others serveas sages, counselors , and repositories of informa-tion and lore for the mind flayers that protect andnourish them .AN ELDER BRAIN'S LAIRThe lair of an elder brain lies deep in the heart ofa mind flayer colony. The brain dwells in a dimlyglowing brine pool filled with brackish water in-fused with its vital fluids and psionic energy.An elder brain's ambitions are always temperedby its relative immobility. Although its telepathicsenses can reach for miles, moving anywhere isalways a dangerous proposition. If forced outsideits brine pool, an e lder brain swiftly expires, andtransporting an elder brain in its pool through con-fining and tortuous subterranean tunn els frequentlyprov es difficult or impossible.rr8 CHAPTER 2 I BESTIARYLAIR ACTIONSOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), an el-der brain can take one of the following lair actions;the elder brain can't take the same lair action tworounds in a row:Force Wall. The elder brain casts wall of force.Psionic Anchor. The elder brain targets one crea-ture it can sense within 120 feet of it and anchorsit by sheer force of will. The target must make aDC 18 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save,its speed is reduced to 0, and it can't teleport. Itcan repeat the saving throw at the end of each ofits turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.Psychic Inspiration. The e lder brain targets onefriendly creature it can sense within 120 feet of it.The t arget has a fl ash of inspiration and gains ad-vantage on one attack roll, ability check, or savingthrow it makes before the end of its next turn.CHAPTER 2 I BESTIARY II9REGIONAL EFFECTSThe territory within 5 miles of an elder brain is al-tered by the creature 's psionic presence, which cre-ates one or more of the following effects:Paranoia.

The foundry is the heart of anyfire giant community. It is a temple, school, provingground, and political hub rolled into one.Those whose primary virtue is brawn are usuallyconsigned to the lowliest of tasks, such as work-ing forge bellows or moving coal. However, thestrongest among these can excel at and gain rankthrough a specialized role: the dreadnought.Dreadnoughts are massively powerful fire giantswho wield two huge shields like plow blades. Theseshields bear spikes on their exterior and have hol-low interiors into which the dreadnought pours hotcoals at the first sign of danger. Armed with thesetwo shields, the dreadnought can present a fierywall to any attacker. When the dreadnought hasfinished, often all that is left of a foe is a smokingsmear on the floor.When not called on to fight, dreadnoughts main-tain their strength by using their shields to shovehuge quantities of coal, stone, or ore a bout thefoundry. Occasionally, dr ea dnoughts are called onby their superiors to accompany a war or diplomaticdelegation and us e their fierce and intimidating de-meanor to strengthen the delegation's position.â–ºFIRE NEWTSOriginally from the Elemental Plane of Fire, fire-newts can be found on the Material Plane near hotsprings and volcanoes.

It may seem harm-less, but if a creat ur e big e nough to be a thr eat ap-proaches too close, the snail fl as h es a scintillatinglight and attacks with its mace-like tentacles.Left undisturb ed, a flail snail moves slowly alongthe ground. It consumes eve rything on the surface,including rocks, sand, and soil, and it stops period-ically to relish crystal growths and oth er larg e min-eral deposits . It leaves behind a shimmering trailthat quickly solidifies into a thin and nearly trans-parent laye r. This glassy residue can be harvestedand cut to form window panes . It can also be h ea tedand spun into other glass objects. Some folk make aliving from trailing flail snails to collect this glass.USING THE SHELL OF A FL A IL SNAILA flail snail shell weighs about 250 pounds and hasnum e rous uses. An intact shell can sell for 5,000 gp.Many hunters seek the shell for its antimagic prop -erties. A skilled armorer ca n make thr ee shieldsfrom one shell. For 1 month, each shield gives itswielder the snail's Antimagic Shell trait. When theshield's magic fades, it beco mes an exotic shieldthat is th e perfect item from which to make a spell-guard shield.A flail snail shell can also be us ed to make arobe of scintillating colors.

It l airs in swa mps and h as four tenta-cles, a thi ck rubbery hide, a fang-filled maw with apr ehensile tongue, an d a n extendable s talk sportingthr ee bulbous eyes that face in different dir ections.Froghemoths are cr eatures not of this world. Ajournal purportedly written long ago by the wizardLum d esc rib es st ra ng e, cylindri ca l chambers ofmetal buried in the ground from which froghemothsemerged, but no reliable r epo rts of the lo ca tion ofsuch pla ces exist.Every few years, a froghemoth ca n lay a fer-tile egg without mating. The fro ghe moth caresnothing for its egg an d might eat the hat chling. Ayoung froghemoth's survival thus depends on itspa re nt leaving it behind in indiffere nce. A new -born frogh emot h grows to full size ov er a periodof months by indiscriminately pr eying on othercreatures in its swampy domain. It learn s to hideits eno rmous body in murky pools, keeping only itseyestalk above water to watch for passing creatures.Wh e n food co me s within reach , the froghe motherupts from its pool, tentacles and tongue flailing. Itcan grab several targets at once; it wraps its tonguearound one and pulls it in to be devoured while hold-ing the r est at bay.If bullywugs (see the Monster Manual) comeacross a froghemoth , th e bullywugs may treat thefroghe moth as a god and do all they ca n to coax themonster into their den. A froghemoth can be tamed(after a fashion) by offering it food , and bullywugscan co mmunicat e with it on a b as ic level, so thecr ea tur e might eat only a few bullywugs beforefollowing the rest. The bullywugs gather food astribute for it, provide it with a comfo rt a bl e lair, pro-tect it from harm , an d try to ens ure that any of itsoffspring r eac h maturity.FROST GIANTEVERLASTING ONETo hold its place or rise within the ordning, a frostgiant must routinely face mighty foes in single com-bat. Some seek out magic that will aid them, but en-chanted objects can be taken or lost. True greatnessrelies on personal prowess. Faced with this truth, afrost giant might seek a supernatural gift from Va-prak the Destroyer.Vaprak is a ferocious god of strength and hungeralso worshiped by some ogres and trolls. He likes totempt frost giants with dreams of glory followed bynightmares of bloody cannibalism. Those who don'tshrink from such visions or report them to priestsof Thrym receive more of the same. If a frost giantcomes to relish these dreams and nightmares, assome do, Vaprak sets a troll upon a sacred quest tofind the frost giant and meet the giant in secret. Thetroll offers up its own body to be devoured in Va-prak's name. Only the boldest and most determinedfrost giants can finish such a gory feast.After devouring the troll sent by Vaprak, bonesand all, a frost giant becomes an everlasting one,gaining tremendous strength, an ill temper, and atroll's regenerative ability. With these gifts, the frostgiant can swiftly claim the title of jar! and easi lyfend off rivals for decades. However, if the frostgiant doesn't give enough honor to Vaprak or failsto heed Vaprak's visions, injuries the frost giant sus-tains heal wrong, resulting in discolored skin; wartyscars; and vestigial body parts, such as extra digits,limbs, and even heads. The touch of Vaprak can nolonger be hidden then, and the everlasting one is ei-ther killed or exiled by their clan. Sometimes smallcommunities of everlasting ones gather and evenreproduce, passing the "blessing" and worship ofVaprak from one generation to the next.FROST GIANT EVERLASTING ONEHuge Gian t, Typ ically Chaotic EvilArmor Class 15 (patchwork armor)Hit Points 189 (l4dl2 + 98)Speed 40 ft .STR25 (+7)DEX9 (-1)CON24 (+7)INT9 (-1)Saving Throws Str +11 , Con +11 , Wis +4,Skills Athletics + ll , Perception +4Damage Immunities coldWIS CHA10 (+0) 12 (+l)Senses darkvis ion 60 ft ., pass ive Perception 14Languages Gi antChallenge 12 (8 ,400 XP) Proficiency Bonus +4Extra Heads.

Ifstarv ed of magic for several w ee ks , it is forced backto its hom e plane , so it constantly se eks new itemsto drain. A gauth might employ cre atur es to bring ititems that can provide it with sust e nan ce.When the ritual to summon a sp ec tator goeswrong , a gauth might push itself through the flawedconn ection, arriving immediat e ly or sev eral minuteslater. It might present itself as a beholder to ignorantcreatur es in an attempt to intimidate th em , or as aspectator to its summoner in order to drain magicitems it is expected to guard.A beholder (see the Monster Manual) usuallydrives away or kills any gauths that enter its terri-tory, but it might choose to force them to serve it aslieutenants . Gauths are less xenophobic than be-holde rs , so they might form small clusters and worktogether, though they' re just as like ly to ignore eachother entirely.CHAPTER 2 I BESTIARY 133GAZERA gazer is a tiny manifestation of the dreams of abeholder. It resembles the beholder who dreamed itinto existence, but its body is only 8 inches wide andit has only four eyestalks.

Beholdersfind gazers amusing and tolerate their presence likespoiled pets. Some beholders with wizard minionsinsist they take a gazer as a familiar because the be-holders can see through the eyes of these creatures .A wild gazer (one living separately from a be-holder) is territorial, eats bugs and little animals ,and is known for playing with its food. A lone wildgazer avoids picking fights with creatures that areMedium or larger, but a pack of them might take onlarger prey. A gazer might follow the folk in its ter-ritory, noisily mimicking their speech and generallybeing a nuisance, until they leave the area, but itflees if confronted by something it can't kill.VARIANT: GAZER FAMILIARSpellcasters who are interested in unusual familiarsfind that gazers are eager to serve someone whohas magical power. Unless its master is strict , agazer familiar can be unruly, behaving aggressivelytoward other Tiny creatures . A gazer serving as afamiliar has the following trait:Familiar. The gazer can serve another creature as a familiar,forming a telepathic bond with its willing ma ster, provided thatthe master is at least a 3rd-level spellcaster. While the two a rebonded , the ma ster can sense what the gazer senses as long asthey are within l mile of each other.

The two have fought forcenturies, each displacing the other innumerabletimes. Currently, Levistus claims lordship over Sty-gia, but he has been trapped in an enormous blockof ice at the command of Asmodeus. In response ,Geryon is marshaling his followers, hoping to usethis opportunity to replace his hated rival.Among the archdevils, Geryon is known for hismartial prowess. He is a ferocious hunter and a re-lentless tracker. He often joins his troops in battle;he loves to feel flesh and steel sundered beneathhis claws and to taste his foes' blood. Yet Geryon'sferocity has also limited his ability to collect soulsand forge an effective hierarchy. Sages who studythe Nine Hells believe the battle for control of Stygiais a test staged by Asmodeus in hopes of purging theworst impulses from both Geryon and Levistus-ordiscovering a competent replacement for both.GERYON's LAIRGeryon has recently reclaimed his ancient fortress,Coldsteel, a sprawling complex that rises from theicy center of Stygia.

In Wild-space and the associated ports , giff are most oftene ncountered as spacefaring mercenaries. Thesetroops are renowned for their martial training andlove of explosives and are typically armed withgleaming pistols and muskets. The stat block hererepr e sents one of those mercenaries.Every aspect of these spacefaring giff's societyis organized along military lines. From birth untildeath , each has a military rank. Promotions don'tdepend on age but are granted by a superior as a re-ward for valor.Muske ts and grenades are th e specialties of manygiff regiments. The bigger the boom, the brighterthe flash, and the thicker the smok e it produces, thegreat er the glory for the one wielding the weapon.Giff mercenaries have been known to accept pay-ment in kegs of gunpowder in preference to gold,gems, or other currency.GUNPOWDER BY THE KEGIn addition to their personal gunpowder weapons ,giff ships and mercenary companies carry sparegunpowder in kegs. In an emergency, or if a largeexplosion is needed, a whole keg can be detonated.A giff lights the fuse on the keg and can then throwthe keg up to 15 feet as part of the same action. Thekeg explodes at the start of the giff's next turn. Eachcreature within 20 feet of th e exploding keg mustmake a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failedsave, a creature takes 24 (7d6) fire damage and isknocked prone. On a successful save, a creaturetakes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.Every other keg of gunpowder within 20 feet ofan exploding keg has a 50 percent chance of alsoexploding. Check each keg only once per turn , nomatter how many other kegs explode around it.GIRALLONLarge Monstrosity, UnalignedArmor Class 13Hit Points 59 (7dl0 + 21)Speed 40 ft., climb 40 ft .STR18 (+4)DEX16 (+3)CON16 (+ 3)Skills Perception +5, Stea lth +5INT5 (-3)WIS12 (+l)Senses darkvision 60 ft ., passive Perception 15Languages -CHA7 (-2)Challenge 4 (1 ,100 XP) Proficiency Bonus +2ACTIONSMultiattack.

The girallon moves up to its speed toward a hostilecreature that it can see.GIRALLONA girallon looks like an oversized, four-armed apewith grayish-tan skin and white fur. Its vicious fangsand claws reveal it to be a monstrous predator.Girallons are most common in temperate or warmforest environments abundant with life. They shareapes' adeptness at climbing, although few trees cansupport the weight of thes e half-ton creatures. Theruins of cities, especially those found in deep forestsand jungles, seem to attract girallons. They see acity's buildings as a superior sort of forest whoseuppermost "branches" can safely support them. Thecreatures can easily scale walls and battlements,and they perch on tower tops and other high van-tages to keep an eye on the surrounding area.When girallons can't climb, they stalk the forestfloor, lurk in narrow ravines or shallow caves, orhide in ruined sites while waiting for prey to comenear. A girallon is surprisingly stealthy, consideringits size and its lack of camouflage.Girallons form loose bands of several individualsand their offspring, usually led by a dominant adultthat also tends to be the oldest member of the group.When on the hunt away from their lair, girallonsuse roars and body language to communicate withone another over distance. Each individual typicallyhunts alone and widely separated from the othersto ensure that everyone gets adequate fodder. Theleader might organize members to work together tomake a big kill, however. If they succeed, everyonein the group shares the spoils, with the best partsgoing to those caring for their young.Girallons' strange appearance and attractionto ruins lead sages to believe they were createdthrough magic to serve as guardians for some lostempire. When that empire fell ages ago, girallonsturned feral and spread out across the world.Numerous creatures have tried to tame, subju-gate, or cooperate with the monsters. For instance ,some forest-dwelling peoples capture girallons andtrain them to serve as sentinels. Recognizing thatgirallons are peaceful among their own kind, otherfolk have learned how to approach a group's leader,offering food and other gifts in hopes of establishingan alliance with the creatures.Girallons that are well treated might be willing toserve as guards, though they lack the intelligenceto take on tasks more complicated than attackingstrangers who enter their domain. A girallon that'scaptured when young and carefully trained couldend up in a seemingly unlikely place, such as guard-ing the entrance to a city's thieves' guild. Those whowould keep a girallon must always be wary, how-ever, becaus e the creature could revert to its preda-tory nature at any time.CHAPTER 2 I BESTIARY 139GITHYANKIGithyanki descend from an ancient people whowere also the progenitors of githzerai (also in thisbook).

The githzerai followers of the great leaderZaerith Menyar-Ag-Gith are an ascetic people wholive apart from the rest of the cosmos, within theconfines of fortresses floating through the chaosof Limbo. Instead of imposing their will on otherpeoples, they focus on controlling and manipulatingtheir endlessly malleable home.GITHZERAI ANARCHAnarchs are githzerai sages and mystics who leadcommunities and maintain the adamantine citadelsthat serve as strong points in Limbo and on otherplanes. They have formidable psionic capabilitiesand are able to manipulate the unformed substanceof their adopted plane with a thought.AN ANARCH'S LAIRIn Limbo, githzerai anarchs create islands of tran-quility in this turbulent plane. An anarch can use itspsionic power to give form to formless substance,creating mountains , lakes, and structures to serveas a foundation for a githzerai community.The anarch's challenge rating is 17 (18,000 XP)when it's encountered in its lair.Lair Actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initia-tive ties), the anarch can take one of the followinglair actions; the anarch can't take the same lair ac-tion two rounds in a row :Create Object. The anarch casts the creation spell(as a 9th-level spell) using the unformed substanceof Limbo instead of shadow material. If used inLimbo, the object remains until the anarch's con-centration is broken, regardless of its composition.If the anarch moves more than 120 feet from theobject, the anarch's concentration breaks.Move Object. The anarch can magically move anobject it can see within 150 feet of it by making aWisdom check with advantage. The DC dependson the object's size: DC 5 for Tiny, DC 10 forSmall, DC 15 for Medium, DC 20 for Large, andDC 25 for Huge or larger.Psionic Bolt. The anarch casts the lightning boltspell (at 5th level), but the anarch can change thedamage type from lightning to cold, fire, psychic,radiant, or thunder. If the spell deals damageother than fire or lightning, it doesn't ignite flam-mable objects.Regional Effects. The region containing an an-arch's lair is warped by its presence, which createsone or more of the following effects:Form Substance. In Limbo, the anarch can spend10 minutes stabilizing a 5-mile area centered on it,causing the unformed substance to take whateverinanimate form the anarch chooses . During thatprocess, the anarch determines the shape andcomposition of the forms created.Stabilize Object. The anarch stabilizes any objectcreated in Limbo and brought to the MaterialPlane for as long as the anarch remains within 1mile of it (no action required).If the anarch dies, these effects end after ld6rounds. All formed substance becomes a chaoticchurn of energy and matter, unraveling into un-formed substance that dissipates ld6 rounds later.GITHZERAI ANARCHMedium Humanoid (Gith) , Any AlignmentArmor Class 20 (Psychic Defense)Hit Points 144 (17d8 + 68)Speed 30 ft. , fly 40 ft.

Despiteits hulking form and terrible appetite, it wants mostof all to bond with an intelligent creature and, oncebonded, to give its life to protect that creature. Greatstrength and a ferocious nature make gray rendersfierce guardians, but they lack a shred of cunning.Gray renders reproduce by forming nodules ontheir bodies that, on reaching maturity, break off tobegin life as young gray renders. They feel no obliga-tion to their young and have no inclination to gatherwith others of their kind. Instead, each has an over-powering need to bond with an intelligent creature.When one encounters a suitable master, it sings tothat creature - a weird, warbling cry accompaniedby scratching at the earth and a show of deference.Once it forms a bond, a gray render serves its mas-ter devotedly.A gray render might be a strong ally, but it'salways an unpredictable one. In combat, a grayrender fights viciously and never willingly harmsits master, but outside battle, it might cause consid-erable difficulties. It might follow its master despitebeing told to stay put, destroy its master's house,burrow holes through a ship's hull, attack out of jeal-ousy, or worse.The Gray Render Quirks table presents possiblequirks for gray renders that can be generated ran-domly or selected as desired.GRAY RENDER QUIRKSdl2 QuirkHates horses and -other mounts2 Roars loudly when its bonded creature istouched by another creature3456789101112Likes to snuggleUproots and chews on treesHas terrific and eye-watering flatulenceBrings offerings of meat to its bonded creatureCompulsively digs up the groundAttacks carts and wagons as if they were terriblemonstersHowls when it rainsWhines piteously in the darkBuries treasure it findsChases birds, leaping into the air to catch them,heedless of the destruction it causes146 CHAPTER 2 I BESTIARYLarge Monstr os ity, Typi ca ll y Ch aotic Neut ralArmor Class 19 (n at ura l armor)Hit Points 18 9 (18d l 0 + 90)Speed 30 ft.STR19 (+4)DEX13 (+ l)CON20 (+5 )Saving Throws Str +8, Co n +9Skills Pe rc eption +2INT3 (-4 )WIS6 (-2 )Senses dar kv ision 60 ft. , passive Perce ption 12Languages -CHA8 (- 1)Challenge 12 (8 ,40 0 XP) Proficiency Bonus +4ACTIONSMultiattack.

Every plane andcurve of his nine-foot-tall body, every glance of hisburning eyes, promises a mixture of pleasure andpain. Graz'zt can transform himself at will, appear -ing in any humanlike form that pleases him or hisonlookers, all equally tempting in their own ways.In every form, though, a subtle wrongness pervadeshis beauty, from the cruel cast of his features to thesix fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot.Graz'zt surrounds himself with the finest of thingsand the most attractive of servants, and he adornshimself in silks and leathers both striking and dis-turbing in their workmanship. His lair and those ofhis cultists are pleasure palaces where nothing isforbidden save moderation and kindness.Cults devoted to him are secret societies of indul-gence, often using their debauchery to subjugateothers through blackmail, addiction, and manip -ulation. They wear alabaster masks with ecstaticexpressions and ostentatious dress and body orna-mentation to their secret assignations .Although he prefers charm and subtle manipu -lation, Graz'zt is capable of terrible violence whenprovoked.

When trained properly, a drake is obedient andterritorial, which makes it an excellent watch beastthat can follow simple commands .Tiamat's cult practices the ritual to create guarddrakes, as do other groups that are skilled in arcanaand associated with Dragons. The ritual requiresa chromatic dragon 's aid; the dragon typicallyhelps to reward its allies or worshipers with a valu-able servant.The ritual, which takes several days, requires10 pounds of fresh dragon scales (donated by thedragon allied with the group), a large amount offresh meat, and an iron cauldron. When the processis complete, a Small egg emerges from the cauldronand hatches within a few hours.A newly hatched guard drake imprints upon thefirst creature that feeds it (usually the one planningto train it), establishing an aggressive but trustingbond with that individual. A guard drake is fullygrown within two to three weeks and can be trainedin the same length of time. It is the equivalent of aguard dog in terms of what it can be trained to do.A guard drake resembles the type of dragon it wascreated from, but with a wingless , squat, muscularbuild.

Theyare incapable of subtlety or trickery, but their de-structive capability is immense.Mortal creatures slain by hellfire engines aredoomed to join the infernal legions in mere hoursunless powerful magic-wielders intervene on theirbehalf.

Devastators are spellcasterswho call down fireballs and other destructive magicin the defense of the court they serve, whether thatcourt is in the Feywild or the Material Plane. A hob-gob lin devastator on the battlefield is a boon to theirallies and a threat to every foe around them.Far from being cloistered academics, hobgoblindevastators are masters of the battlefield. In addi-tion to tactical applications of the magical arts, theylearn the basics of weapon use, and they measuretheir deeds by the enemies defeated though theirmagic. They have the respect of other members ofthe host and receive obedience and deference frommany quarters.In the Feywild, many archfey seek to bolstertheir armies' might with the services of hobgoblindevastators.GOBLINOIDS OF THE FEYWILDThe goblinoid peoples-goblins , hobgoblins , andbugbears-first appeared in the Feywild millennia ago,and they resided there until the god Maglubiyet con-quered them . They then spread throughout the multi-verse, with many of them ending up on the worlds ofthe Material Plane. Most goblinoids encountered onthose worlds are members of families that have beenaway from the Feywild for centuries, and over time,those lineages have become Humanoid. Fey gobli-noids , who still bear the magic of the Feywild, are rareon the Material Plane but not unheard of.

Howlers can be domesticated, after afashion, but they respond only to brutal training inwhich they are forced to recognize the trainer asthe pack's undisputed leader. A trained pack thenfollows its leader without hesitation.

Alliances form all the time, but most wind upunraveling due to treachery. Nevertheless, for alltheir backbiting and betrayal, devils do occasionallydisplay loyalty, offering unwavering service to theirmasters. One such example is Hutijin, a duke of Ca-nia and loyal servant of Mephistopheles.Across the Hells, Hutijin's name fills lesser devilswith fear and loathing, for this duke commands twocompanies of pit fiends (see the Monster Manual).With such soldiers under his command, Hutijin caneasily crush any rival who gets in his way while alsodefending Mephistopheles against armies seek-ing to contest his dominion . Hutijin has amassedenough power to challenge the lord of Cania , but hehas never wavered in his support for his master-suggesting, perhaps, that Mephistopheles has somehold over him.r56 CHAPTER 2 I BESTIARYâ€¢Outside the Nine Hells, Hutijin is a relativelyobscure figure, known only to the most learned in-fernal scholars. He has no cults of his own, and hisservants are few in number. The reason is simple:Hutijin hates mortals. When summoned from theHells, he repays the instigator with a long and ago-nizing death.Mephistopheles forbids Hutijin from makingtoo many forays into the Material Plane , since theduke's absence leaves him vulnerable to his rivals.Other archdevils know how much Hutijin despisesmortals and have secretly disseminated the meansto call him from the Nine Hells in the hope ofdistracting the archdevil long enough for them toassail Mephistopheles. Hutijin sends devils into theMaterial Plane to eradicate mention of his nameand destroy those who have learned of him, but thesummonings still occur.

In the OuterPlanes, ki-rins in service to benevolent deities takea direct role in the eternal struggle between goodand evil. In the mortal world, ki-rins are celebratedfar and wide as harbingers of destiny, guardians ofthe sacred, and counterbalances to the forces of evil.Ki -rins are an embodiment of good, and simply be-holding one can evoke fear or awe in an observer. Atypical ki-rin looks like a muscular stag, covered ingolden scales lined in some places with golden fur.It has a long mane and tail, coppery cloven hooves,and a spiral-shaped coppery horn just above and be-tween its luminous violet eyes. In a breeze or whenaloft, the creature's scales and hair appear to blazewith a holy, golden fire.Beyond their coloration, ki-rins vary in appear-ance based on the deity each one reveres and thefunction each typically performs in service to thatgod. Some resemble gigantic unicorns; these areoften used as guardians. Others have draconicfeatures and tend to be aggressive foes of evil.Having one horn is most common, but a par-ticularly fierce ki-rin might have two hornsor a set of antlers like those of a great stag.In many lands, common folk view ki-rins asheralds of good fortune. They consider seeinga ki-rin fly overhead a blessing and events that hap-pen on such a day especially auspicious. If a ki-rinalights during a ceremony such as a birth announce-ment or a coronation, everyone present understandsthat the creature is telling them the person so hon-ored could become a great force for good. Ki-rinshave also been known to appear at the sites of greatbattles to inspire and strengthen the side of good orto rescue heroes from certain death.Ki-rins are attracted to the worship of deities ofcourage, loyalty, selflessness, and truth, as well asto the advancement of just societies. For instance, inthe Forgotten Realms, ki-rins rally mostly to Torm,although they also serve his allies Tyr and Ilmater.Ki-rins that serve good deities go wherever they arecommanded; a ki-rin from an Upper Plane mightventure to the Material Plane on a mission, usuallyas a scout, a messenger, or a spy. A ki-rin living onthe Material Plane claims a territory to watch over,and one ki-rin might safeguard an area that encom-passes several nations.LAIR OF LUXURYOn the ce lestial plan es, ki-rins reside in lofty, ele-gant aeries fill ed with luxurious objects. On the Ma-terial Plane, a ki-rin c hoo ses a similar lo cat ion forits lair, such as atop a tall pinnacl e or within a cloudsolidified by th e ki-rin's magic. The chosen locationis almost always hard to reach, and only those mor-tals who have the tenacity to complete the dauntingjourney to a ki-rin's lair can prove themselves wor-thy of speaking with its occupant. Many of thosewho do end up pledging service to the creature.They study under its tutelage in its lair and serve asits agents in the world. These followers might travelincognito across the land, seeking news of growingevil and working behind the scenes, or they mightbe champions of their master's cause, out to defeatvillainy wherever it is found.When viewed from the outside, a ki-rin's lair is in-distinguishable from a natural site, and the entranceis difficult for visitors to find and reach . Inside, thela ir is a serene and co mfortabl e place, its ambiancea mix be tw een palace and temple.

In the depths of the MaterialPlane, korreds typically flee from other creatures,but they become aggressive when they feel insultedor are annoyed by the sounds of mining.Korreds can hurl boulders far larger than it seemsthey should be able to, shape stone as though it wereclay, and swim through rock. They also gain super-natural strength just from standing on the ground.MAGICAL HAIRKorreds have hair all over their bodies, but the hairthat grows from their heads is magical. When cut,it transforms into whatever material was used tocut it. Korreds use iron shears to cut lengths of thismagical hair, then twist the strands together to cre-ate iron ropes that they can manipulate, animatingthem to bind or snake around creatures and objects.Korreds take great pride in their hair and equallygreat offense at anyone who attempts to cut it with-out permission.166 CHAPTER 2 I BESTIARYKORREDSmall Fey, Typically Chaotic NeutralArmor Class 17 (natural armor)Hit Points 93 (lld6 + 55)Speed 30 ft ., burrow 30 ft.STR23 (+6)DEX14 (+2)CON20 (+5)INT10 (+O)WIS15 (+ 2)Skills Athletics +9 , Perception +5, Stealth +5CHA9 (- 1)Damage Resistances bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing fromnonmagical attacksSenses darkvision 120 ft. , tremorsense 120 ft .,passive Perception 15Languages Dwarvish, Gnomish , Sylvan , Terran , UndercommonChallenge 7 (2 ,900 XP) Proficiency Bonus +3Stone Camouflage.

They are attracted to sources of heat, such asdwarven forges and pools of molten lava, and carveout lairs as close to such locations as possible. Asthey burrow through the earth , they leave behindtunnels - evidence that is often the first clue to thenearby presence of a kruthik hive. Kruthiks alsomake use of preexisting underground chambers, in-corporating them into their lairs when they can.Kruthiks communicate with one anotherthrough a series of hisses and chittering noises.These sounds can often be heard in advance ofa kruthik attack. Whenever their lair is invaded,kruthik guards send out an alarm by rapidlytapping the stone floor with their sharp legs.In addition to having an acute sense ofsmell, kruthiks can se e in the dark and candetect vibrations in the earth around them.They take the scent of their own dead as awarning and avoid areas where many other kruth-iks have died. Slaying a sufficient number of kruth-iks in one area might cause the remaining hivemembers to move elsewhere.Although they can feed on carrion, kruthiks pre-fer live prey. They kill enem ies by impaling themon their spiked limbs, then grind up the flesh andbones with mandibles strong enough to chew rock.When several kruthiks gang up on a single foe , theybecome frenzied and eve n more lethal.Kruthiks abide the presence of Constructs, El-ementals, Oozes, and Undead, and they use suchcreatures to help guard their hive. They are smartenough to barricade some tunnels and dig new onesthat keep their neighbors away from their eggs.YOUNG KRUTHIKKruthiks hatch from eggs laid by female adults.Each egg is about the size of an adult human's h eadand hatches within a month. Tiny kruthik hatch-lings are harmless and rarely stray far from thenest. They feed primarily on offal and one another.Within a month, the survivors become young kruth-iks large enough to hunt and defend themselves.168 CHAPTER 2 I BESTIARYYOUNG KRUTHIKSmall Monstrosity, Unali gnedArmor Class 16 (natural armor)Hit Points 9 (2d6 + 2)Speed 30 ft. , burrow 10 ft ., climb 30 ft .STR13 (+l)DEX16 (+3)Skills Perception +4CON13 (+l)INT4 (-3)WIS10 (+ O)Senses darkvision 30 ft., tremorsense 60 ft .,passive Perception 14Languages KruthikCHA6 (-2 )Challenge 1/8 (25 XP) Proficiency Bonus +2Pack Tactics.

While many ofthe hye nas that ate Yeenoghu'skills transformed into gnolls,others und er w en t more bi-zarre c hang es; leucro ttas werethe most num erous of thes e.As clever as it is cruel, aleucrotta lov es to d ece ive, torture, and kill. Crea-tures who venerate Yeenoghu- particularly hisgno ll followe rs -v iew leucrottas with great r es pec t.Although a leucrotta is unlike ly to lead a gnoll warband, it can influence the lea der and might agree tocarry the leader into battle and offer advice duringthe fight. Followers ofYeenoghu also see leucrottasas a form of entertainment. They enjoy watching ale u crotta work almost as much as they like doingtheir own killing, since leucrottas are meticulous intheir cruelty and able to draw out kills for better andlong er sport. And when there are no victims to behad, a leucrotta can mimic the delightful sq u eals ofa suffering victim.A leucrotta is so lo athsome that few outside ofits own kind can stand to be around one for long.Its horrific, hodgepodge body oozes a foul stench.This reek is outdone only by the creature's breath,which issues from a maw that drips fluid corruptedwith rot and digestive juices. In place of fangs, aleucrotta has bony ridges as hard as steel that cancrush bones and lacerate flesh. These plates are sotough that a le ucrotta can use them to peel plate ar-mor away from the body of a slain knight.A leucrotta's stench would normally warn awayprey long before the creature could attack. It hastwo natural capabilities, however, that give it anadvantage. First, a leucrotta's tracks are nearlyimpossible to distinguish from those of commondeer. Second, it can duplicate th e call or the vocalexpress ions of just about any creature it has h ear d.The monster uses its mimicry to lur e in potentialvictims, then attacks while they ar e confused or un -aware of th e actual threat.170 CHAPTER 2 I BESTIARYLEUCROTTALarg e Monstrosity, Typically Chaotic EvilAr mo r Class 14 (natura l armor)Hit Points 67 (9d l0 + 18)Speed 50 ft.STR18 (+ 4)DEX14 (+2)CON15 (+2)INT9 (- 1)Skills Deception +2, Perception +5â€¢WIS12 (+l )Senses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 15Languages Abyssal, Gnol lCHA6 (- 2)Challenge 3 (7 00 XP) Proficiency Bonus +2Mimicry.

Thesebipeds have the h eads and claws of crustaceans,and they primarily live in forests, although theyadapt well to urban and subterranean settings.Meenlocks are spawned by fear. When terroroverwhelms a creature in the Feywild or anotherlocation where the Feywild's influence is strong, oneor more meenlocks might spontaneously arise inthe shadows or darkness nearby. If more than onemeenlock is born, a lair also magically forms. Theearth creaks and moans as narrow, twisting tunnelsopen up within it. One of these passageways serv esas the lair's only entrance , and a large central cham-ber serves as the meenlocks' den. Inside the warren,black moss covers every surface, muffling sound .A meenlock can supernaturally sense areas ofdarkness and shadow in its vicinity and can teleportfrom one darkened space to another - enabling it tosneak up on its prey or run away when outmatched.Meenlocks also project a supernatural aura that in-stills terror in those nearby.TELEPATHIC TORMENTUp to four meenlocks can telepathically tormentone incapacitated creature, filling its mind with dis-turbing sounds and dreadful imagery. Participatingmeenlocks can't use their telepathy for any otherpurpose during this time, though they can moveabout and take actions and reactions as normal.This torment has no effect on a creature that is im-mune to the frightened condition. If the creature issusceptible and remains incapacitated for 1 hour,the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw ,taking 10 (3d6) psychic damage on a failed save, orhalf as much damage on a successful one . The saveDC is 10 + the number of meenlocks participatingin the torment, considering only those that remainwithin sight of the victim for the entire hour andaren't incapacitated during it. The process can berepeated. A Humanoid that drops to O hit points asa result of this damage instantly transforms into ameenlock at full health and under the DM's control.Only a wish spell or divine intervention can restorea transformed creature to its former state.178 CHAPTER 2 I BESTIARYSmall Fey, Typically Neutral EvilArmor Class 15 (natural armor)Hit Points 31 (7d6 + 7)Speed 30 ft.STR7 (-2)DEX15 (+2)CON12 (+l)INT11 (+ 0)Skills Perception +4, Stealth +6, Survival +2Condition Immunities frightenedWIS10 (+0)Senses darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 14Languages telepathy 120 ft .CHA8 (-1)Challenge 2 (450 XP) Proficiency Bonus +2Fear Au ra.

Acreature in telepathic communication with a mind-witness can converse through it to as many as sevenother creatures the mindwitness can see, rapidlydisseminating commands and other information.If separated from its illithid masters, a mindwit-ness seeks out other telepathic creatures to tell itwhat to do.

Long ago, Mo-loch earned his place among the other archdevilsthrough the glory he won driving demons out of theNine Hells. Asmodeus rewarded him by elevatinghim to the rulership of Malbolge.For eons, Moloch ruled his domain, vying againstthe other archdevils as he sought still greater power.This animosity worked in Asmodeus's favor, sinceAsmodeus knew that Moloch's scheming helpedkeep the other archdevils in check. The arrange-ment unraveled, however, when Moloch took thenight hag named Malagard for his advisor. Her poi-sonous words gradually convinced him to attempt totopple Asmodeus. The conspiracy nearly succeeded,but was ultimately thwarted . Moloch was stripped ofhis station and sentenced to death - only the timelyuse of a planar portal allowed him to escape .Moloch wasted no time in preparing for his return.He amassed an army of devils and monsters andleft them to make final preparations for invading theNine Hells, while he ventured to the Material Planein search of an art ifact that would ensure his suc-cess. But while there, he became trapped, leaving182 CHAPTER 2 I BESTIARYâ€¢his armies at the mercy of his enemies. They weredestroyed in short order .Moloch was rendered nearly powerless by this fail-ure. He schemes of ways to reclaim his former sta-tus, but every time he enters the Nine Hells, he is de-moted to an imp (see the Monster Manual) and can'tregain his normal powers until he leaves. Thus, helives a split existence, sometimes plotting in Mal-bolge or other layers of the Hells and at other timeswandering the planes in search of magical might orsecrets that might help him win back his title.Rumors suggest that he can often be found inSigil, where he bargains with yugoloths to build yetanother army with which he might invade Malbolgeand wrest the throne from Glasya. Bereft as he is,he has little to offer in exchange, so he might bar-gain with mortals to gain their aid in acquiring coin,jewels, and other riches in return for knowledgeabout the Nine Hells and the other planes.Most of Moloch's cultists have switched allegianceto one of the other archdevils, but idols constructedto honor him still stand in deep dungeons , theirjeweled eyes and the remnants of power they holddrawing monstrous worshipers and unwise adven-turers into places where his foul influence remains.MOLOCHLarge Fiend (Devil), Lawful EvilArmor Class 19 (natural armor)Hit Points 253 (22dl0 + 132)Speed 30 ft.STR26 (+8)DEX19 (+4)CON22 (+ 6)INT21 (+ 5)WIS18 (+ 4)Saving Throws Dex+ 11, Con +13, Wis +11, Cha+ 13Skills De ce ptio n +13 , Intimidati on +13 , Perception +11CHA23 (+6)Damage Resistances cold; bludgeo ning, piercing, and slashingfrom nonmagical attacks that aren 't silveredDamage Immunities fire, poisonCondition Immunities charmed, exhaustion , frightened,poisonedSenses darkvision 120 ft ., pass ive Perception 21Languages all, telepathy 120 ft .Challenge 21 (33,000 XP) Proficiency Bonus +7Legendary Resistance (3/Day).

Each one floats through the planes on astrange, mobile island, amassing the valuables,oddities, and castoffs of the multiverse in a massive,ever-growing collection.The first morkoths arose in the Astral Plane whenthe petrified body of a deity of greed and strife co l-lid ed with a remnant of ce lestial matter imbued withlife-giving magic. The collision released a storm ofchaotic energy and sent countless islands spinningaway into the void. Within some of them, bits of thegod's petrified flesh came back to life as morkoths:tentacled monstrosities brimming with maliceand greed .Morkoths are driven by greed and selfishnessmixed with a yearning for conflict. They hoard vaststores of treasure, knowledge, and captives on theirislands. Some of these prisoners are the descen-dants of people captured generations before; theymight know of no other world outside their island.A morkoth may a llow a visitor to bargain for some-thing or someone it has claimed if that visitor offersthe morkoth something it desires more. It shows nomercy, however, to those who break a deal or try tosteal from it. A morkoth knows every person andobject in its collection.A morkoth's island has the qualities of a dream-scape . It holds a jumble of objects and creatures themorkoth has collected, some of which date from for-gotten times. An island might have natural-lookingillumination, but most are shrouded in twilight, andon any of them, mists and shadows can appear with-out notice. The environment is warm and wet, a sub-tropical or tropical climate that keeps the morkothand its "guests" comfortable.Each island glides on planar currents and is safefrom most harmful external effects- one couldfloat in the skies of Avernus in the Nine Hells with-out harm to it or its residents. A morkoth's islandmight be found anywhere from the bottom of theocean to the void of the Astral Plane. Anything onor within a ce rtain distance of a morkoth's isle isdrawn with it in its journey through the planes.Thus, people from lost civilizations and creatures orobjects from bygone ages might be found within amorkoth's dominion.Some islands travel a specific route, arriv ingat the same destinations regularly over a cycle ofyears. Others a re tied to a particular place or groupof loca les, and still others move erratica ll y throughthe cosmos. Occasionally, a morkoth learns to directits island's movement.A MoRKOTH's LAIRA morkoth claims dominion over an entire island,and it also maintains a central sanctum on thatisle. This lair is most often a twisted network ofnarrow tunnels that connect several undergroundch ambers, although other structural forms mightbe incorporated. The morkoth dwells among thecr eatures and objects it prizes most in a spaciousvault at the center of the warren, where the celestialfragments that make up the island's core are alsolo cated. Sections of the lair and its center mightbe kept dry to better protect and preserve col-lected objects and creatures, but most of the lair isunderwater.A morkoth encountered in its lair has a challengerating of 12 (8,400 XP).LAIR ACTIONSOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), themorkoth can take one of the following lair actions:Cast a Spell. The morkoth casts darkness, dispelmagic, or misty step, using Intelligence as its spell-cast in g ability and without expending a spell slot.Hypnotize. The morkoth uses its Hypnosis action,originating at a point within 120 feet of itself. Itdoesn't need to see the effect's point of origin.CHAPTER 2 I BEST I ARY 185/REGIONAL EFFECTSThe island surrounding a morkoth's lair is warpedby the creature's presence , creating the follow-ing effects:Alter Water. With a thought (no action required),the morkoth can initiate a change in the waterwithin its lair that takes effect 1 minute later. Thewater can be as breathabl e and clear as air, orit can be normal water (ranging in clarity frommurky to clear).Locate Creatures and Objects. The morkoth isaware of any new arrival, whether an object ora creature, on its island or in its sanctum. As anaction, the morkoth can locate any one creatureor object on the island. Visitors to the island feelas though they are being watched, even whenthey aren 't.Lost Possessions. Each tim e a creature that hasb ee n on the island for less than a year finishesa short or long rest , it must make a DC 10 Intel-ligence saving throw. On a failure, the creaturehas misplaced one possession (chosen by theplaye r, if the creature is that player's character).The possession remains nearby but concealedfor a short time, so it can be recovered with aMORKOTHLarge Aberration , Typically Chaotic EvilArmor Class 17 (natural armor)Hit Points 165 (22dl0 + 44)Speed 25 ft. , swim 50 ft .STR14 (+2)DEX14 (+2)CON14 (+2)INT20 (+5)Saving Throws Dex +6, Int +9, Wis +6WIS15 (+2)CHA13 (+l)Skills Arcana +9 , History +9, Perception+ 10, Stealth +6Senses blindsight 30 ft ., darkvision 120 ft., passivePerception 20Languages telepathy 120 ft.Challenge 11 (7,200 XP) Proficiency Bonus +4Amphibious.

If the creaturelater goes to the morkoth's lair, its lost posses-sions stand out in its perception and are easilyrecovered.Supernatural Lure. Entrances to the morkoth'slair have an enchantment that the morkoth canactivate or suppress at any time while it's in its lairand not incapacitated. Any creature within 30 feetof such an entrance and able to se e it must make aDC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, thecreature feels an intense urge to use its movementon each of its turns to enter the lair and to movetoward the morkoth's location (the target doesn'trealize it's heading toward a creature). The targetmoves toward the morkoth by the most directroute. As soon as it can see the morkoth, the tar-get can repeat the saving throw, ending the effecton itself on a success. It can also repeat the savingthrow at the end of each of its turns and everytime it takes damage.If the morkoth dies, these regional effects endimmediately.+ 2) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns, andthe morkoth can't use its tentacles on another target.Hypnosis. The morkoth projects a 30-foot cone of magicalenergy. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Wisdomsaving throw. On a failed save, the creature is charmed by themorkoth for l minute. While charmed in this way , the targettries to get as close to the morkoth as possible, using its ac-tions to Dash until it is within 5 feet of the morkoth. A charmedtarget can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of itsturns and whenever it takes damage, ending the effect on itselfon a success . If a creature's saving throw is successful or theeffect ends for it, the creature has advantage on saving throwsagainst the morkoth's Hypnosis for 24 hours .Spellcasting.

If the morkoth makes a successful savingthrow against a spell or a spell attack misses it, the morkothcan choose another creature (including the spellcaster) it cansee within 120 feet of it. The spell targets the chosen creatureinstead of the morkoth. If the spell forced a saving throw, thechosen creature makes its own save. If the spell was an attack,the attack roll is rerolled against the chosen creature.MOUTH OF GROLANTORHill giants consume spoiled food and diseased car-c ass es with as much enthusiasm as children eatingde ssert and rarely suffer for such eating habits.Wh en one of their kind becomes incapable of keep-ing down food , that giant is se en, among hill giantworshipe rs of the god Grolantor , as the ve ssel of ame ssag e from the deity.The sickened giant's compatriots se parat e thegiant from the rest of the community, often trappingthem in a cage or tying them to a post.

If they think they can killa creature and consume its soul, they attack- evenif that other creature is a demon, including an-other nabassu.Most other demons shun nabassus and force themto live on the fringes of the Abyss. There, nabassuspick off weaker demons or, if the situation warrants,gather in packs to take down larger prey. Some es-pecially powerful nabassus even search for demonlords' amulets.Whenever magic pulls demons from the Abyss tothe Material Plane, nabassus try to get summonedso that they can embark on a feast of souls there.A summoned nabassu seeks to break free so thatit can devour the soul of its summoner and thenfeed on the souls of whatever other creatures it cancatch. One way a summoner can avoid this fate is byproviding a steady supply of souls to the nabassu,which might persuade the demon to be coopera-tive- as long as the supply lasts.NABASSUMedium Fiend (Demon), Typically Chaotic EvilArmor Class 18 (natural armor)Hit Points 190 (20d8 + 100)Speed 40 ft. , fly 60 ft .STR22 (+6)DEX14 (+2)CON21 (+5)Saving Throws Str +11 , Dex +7Skills Perception +7INT14 (+2)WIS15 (+2)CHA17 (+3)Damage Resistances cold, fire , lightning; bludgeon ing,piercing, and slashing from nonmagica l attacksDamage Immunities poisonCondition Immunities poisonedSenses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 17Languages Abyssal , telepathy 120 ft.Challenge 15 (13 ,000 XP) Proficiency Bonus +5Demonic Shadows.

Shetransformed them into the scabrous , birdlike crea-tures known as nagpas and rend ered them able toacquire new lore and magical powe r only from theruins of fallen civilizations and great calamities.Nagpas still fear the Raven Queen and do theirbest to avoid her and her agents. When it's impossi-ble to do so, they become cringing, fawning things,eager to please and thereby escape further attentionfrom her cold gaze. All the original thirteen remainalive, thanks to their cunning and their willingnessto do whatever is necessary to survive.Hungry to claim more power despite the Ra-ven Queen 's curse, nagpas strive to bring aboutworld-shaking destruction . From the shadows, theymanipulate events to bring about ruin. They canbring to bear an array of spells to turn other crea-tures into their agents, influencing their decisionsin subtle ways and making them unwitting accom-plices in their own destruction . Nagpas are extraor-dinarily patient and pursue several schemes simul-taneously, so if one plan goes awry, they can shifttheir focus to another. Typically, nagpas emergefrom the shadows only when they can deliver afinishing blow. They then revel in th e grand devasta-tion their plotting brought about - looting libraries,plundering vaults , and prying secr e ts of arcane loreand power from the wreckage.CHAPTER 2 I BESTIARY 189NARZUGONPaladins who make deals with devils and carrytheir twisted sense of honor into the afterlife areespecially valuable to the archdukes of the NineHells.

It can poison the body and themind of its targets and can subjugate even be-ings that are physically superior.Neogi usually dwell in far-flung locationson the Material Plane, as well as in theAstral Plane and the Ethereal Plane. Theyleft their home world long ago to conquerand devour creatures in other realms .During this era, they dominated umberhulks and used them to build sleek, spideryships capable of traversing the multiverse.NEOGI HATCHLINGA neogi lives about a century. When an in-dividual is rendered weak by advanced age,the other neogi in the group overpower itand inject it with a special poison . The toxintransforms the old neogi into a bloated massof flesh. Younger neogi lay their eggs atop it,and when the hatchlings emerge, they devourthe old neogi and one another until only a fewof the strongest newborns are left. The survivingneogi hatchlings begin their lives under the controlof adult neogi. They must le arn about their societyand earn a place in it, and each one starts its train-ing by gaining mastery over an umber hulk.NEOGI (ADULT)The mentality of neogi is alien to many other peo-ples. Because adult neogi have the power to con-trol minds, they consider doing so to be entirelyappropriate. Their society makes no distinctionbetween individuals, aside from the ability that agiven creature has to control others, and they don'tcomprehend the emotional aspects of existence thathumans and similar beings experience. To a neogi,hatred is as foreign a sensation as love, and show-ing loyalty in the absence of authority is foolishness.Neogi mark themselves and those they capturethrough the use of dyes, transformational magic,and other markings intended to signify rank,achievements, and the identity of the individual'sleader. By these signs, neogi can identify each oth-ers' place in the hierarchy - and they must defer tothose of higher station or risk harsh punishment.NEOGI MASTERNeogi masters use magic, as a result of a pact be-tween neogi and aberrant entities they met duringtheir journey from their home world.

ICHAPTER 2 I BESTIARY 193NIGHTWALKERThe Negative P lane is a place of death, anathemato all living things. Yet there are some who wouldtap into its fell power and use its energy for sin isterends. Most individuals prove unequal to the task.Those not destroyed outright are sometimes drawninside the plane and replaced by nightwalkers-ter-rifying Undead creatures that devour all life theyencounter.One can reach the Negative Plane from the Shad-owfell in places where the barrier between theplanes is thin . Stepping onto the Negative Plane isalmost always fatal since the plane sucks the lifeand soul from creatures, annihilating most at once .The few who survive by sheer luck or by harnessingsome rare form of protective magic soon discoverthat they can't leave as easily as they arrived.Worse, for each creature that enters the plane, anightwalker is re leased to take its place. In orderfor a trapped creature to escape, the released night-walker must be lured back to the Negative Plane byofferings of life for it to devour. If the nightwalkeris destroyed, the trapped creature has no hopeof escape.Generally, a nightwalker on the Material Plane isattracted to elements of the world associated withthe creature responsible for its creation, which canprovide clues as to who the trapped creature is. Thisattraction doesn't indicate a willingness to engagewith the world, though; nightwalkers exist to makelife extinct, and they prioritize anything associatedwith the trapped creature for destruction.NIGHTWALKERHuge Undead, Typically Chaotic EvilArmor Class 14Hit Points 337 (2Sdl 2 + 175)Speed 40 ft ., fly 40 ft.STR22 (+6)DEX19 (+4)CON24 (+7)Saving Throws Con +13INT6 (-2)WIS9 (-1)CHA8 (-1)Damage Resistances acid , cold, fire, lightning, thunder;bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacksDamage Immunities necrotic, poisonCondition Immunities exhaustion , fr ightened, grappled,paralyzed, petrified , poisoned, prone, restrainedSenses darkvision 120 ft ., passive Perception 9Languages-Challenge 20 (25 ,000 XP) Proficiency Bonus +6An nih ilating Aura .

Goblins have no name for this deity anddare not give it one, lest Maglubiyet use its name toensnare and crush it as he did their other deities.They call the possessing spirit, as well as the goblinpossessed by it, a nilbog ("goblin" spelled back-ward), and they revel in the chaos a nilbog sows .Whenever goblinoids form a host, there is achance that a goblin will become possessed by a nil-bog, particularly if the goblins have been mistreatedby their betters. The possessed goblin turns into awisecracking, impish creature fearless of reprisal.This nilbog also gains strange powers that drive oth-ers to do the opposite of what they desire. Attackingthe possessed goblin is foolhardy, and killing themjust prompts the spirit to possess another goblin.The only way to keep a nilbog from wreaking havocis to treat it well and give it respect and praise.Among fey courts, the risk of attracting a nilboghas given rise to the practice of always including atleast one goblin jester. This jester is allowed to goanywhere and do whatever they please, hopefullypreventing a nilbog from manifesting. The positionof jester is much sought-after among the courts' gob-lins, because even if the jester is obviously not a nil-bog, the court must indulge their chaotic behavior.NILBOGISMA nilbog is an invisible spirit that possesses onlygoblins. When bereft of a host, the spirit has a flyingspeed of 30 feet, it can't be attacked, and it is im-mune to all damage and conditions. Acting on initia-tive count 20 (losing initiative ties), the only actionit can take is to attempt to possess a goblin within 5feet of it.A goblin targeted by the spirit must succeed ona DC 15 Charisma saving throw or become pos-sessed . While possessed, the goblin uses the nilbogstat block. If the save succeeds, the spirit can't pos-sess that goblin for 24 hours.If its host is killed or the possession is ended by aspell such as hallow, magic circle, or protection fromevil and good, the spirit searches for another goblinto possess. The spirit can leave its host at any time,but it won't do so willingly unless it knows there'sanother potential host nearby. A goblin stripped oftheir nilbog spirit reverts to their normal statisticsand loses the traits they gained while possessed.

These jobs are tailored to take advan-tage of an ogre's strengths.OGRE BATTERING RAMAn ogre battering ram carries an enormous clubthat's primarily used for bashing doors into kindlingbut also works well for smashing foes.

An ogre bolt launcher can lo ad this immens eweapon and loose its deadly missile as quickly asa dwarf handles a crossbow. The bolts are so largethat few ogres can carry more than a half dozen ata time, but bolt launchers have been known to up-root small trees or tear beams out of buildings andlaunch those when their ammunition runs low.OGRE CHAIN BRUTEAn ogre chain brute wields a greatspiked chain, swinging it with bothhands in a wide circle to knock foes offtheir feet. Alternatively, the ogre canswing the chain in a crushing over-head smash.OGRE HOWDAHThe most unusual of the specializedogres, the howdah carries a palisadedwooden fort on its back .

Thesedevils are infernal bounty hunters, tireless in theirpursuit of their quarry across the multi verse.Orthons are infamous for their sharp senses.Because an orthon can become invisible at will, itsquarry is often unaware of being hunted until the or-thon strikes. This invisibility can be disrupted whenthe devil is attacked, however, so a strong counterat-tack is often the best defense against it.Orthons value the challenge of the chase and thethrill of one-on-one combat above all else. An or-thon's first loyalty is to its archduke, but one with noimmediate assignment might work for anyone whopromises it a worthy struggle against a lethal foe.Because they travel widely, orthons are unequaledas guides through the layers of the Nine Hells.0RTHONLarge Fiend (Devil), Typically Lawful EvilArmor Class 17 (half plate)Hit Points 105 (lOdl0 + 50)Speed 30 ft., climb 30 ft.STR22 (+6)DEX16 (+3)CON21 (+5)INT15 (+2)Saving Throws Dex +7, Con +9, Wis +6WIS15 (+2)Skills Perception +10, Stealth +11, Survival +10CHA16 (+3)Damage Resistances cold; bludgeoning , piercing, and slashingfrom nonmagical attacks that aren't si lveredDamage Immunities fire, poisonCondition Immunities charmed, exhaustion , poisonedSenses darkvision 120 ft., trues ight 30 ft.,passive Perception 20Languages Common , Infernal , telepathy 120 ft.Challenge 10 (5,900 XP) Proficiency Bonus +4Magic Resistance.

These slen-der Fey resemble miniature elves with feralfeatures and cold eyes thatgleam like jewels. Racingfaster than the eye can track,they appear as little morethan blurry waverings in the air.Quicklings owe their existence-and their plight-to the Queen of Air and Darkness, the dread rulerof the Gloaming Court. Once a species of lazy andegotistical Fey, quicklings' predecessors were latein answering the queen's summons one time toomany. To hasten their pace and teach them to mindher will, the queen sped up their internal clocks andshrank them. Her curse gave quicklings amazingspeed but also accelerated their passage throughlife-no quickling lives longer than fifteen years.The mortal realm is a ponderous place to a quick-ling's eye: a hurricane creeps gradua lly across thesky, a torrent of rain drifts earthward like lazy snow-flakes, lightning crawls in a meandering path fromcloud to cloud. The slow and boring world seems tobe populated by torpid creatures whose deep , moo-ing speech lacks meaning.To other creatures, quicklings seem blindinglyfast, vanishing into an indistinct blur as they move.Their cruel laughter is a burst of rapid staccatosounds, their speech a shrill squeal. Only whenquicklings deliberately slow down , which they prefernot to do, can other beings properly see, hear, andcomprehend them. Never truly at rest, "stationary"quicklings constantly pace and shift in place, asthough they can't wait to be off again.Quicklings have a capricious nature that goeswell with their energy level: they think as fast asthey run, and they are always up to something.They spend most of their time perpetrating acts ofmischief on slower creatures. One rarely passes upan opportunity to tie a person 's bootlaces together,move the stool a creature is about to sit on, or un-buckle a saddle while no one's looking.Tricks of that sort are hardly the limit of quick-lings' artful malice , however. They don't commitoutright murder, but they can ruin lives in plentyof other ways: stealing an important letter, swipingcoins collected for the poor, planting a stolen itemin someone's bag. Quicklings enjoy causing suffer-ing that transcends mere mischief, especially whenthe blame for their actions falls on others and cre-ates discord .â€¢â€¢â€¢QUICKLINGTiny Fey, Typically Chaotic EvilArmor Class 16Hit Points 10 (3d4 + 3)Speed 120 ft .STR4 (-3)DEX23 (+6)CON13 (+l)INTl 0 (+ 0)WIS12 (+l)Skills Acrobatics +8 , Sleight of Hand +8 , Stealth +8,Perception +5Senses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 15Languages Common , SylvanCHA7 (-2)Challenge l (200 XP) Proficiency Bonus +2Blurred Movement .

Redcaps, although small, have formidablestrength, which they use to hunt and kill withouthesitation or regret.In the Feywild, or where that plane touchesthe material world at a fey crossing , if asentient creature acts on an intense desirefor bloodshed, one or more redcaps mightappear where the blood of a slain personsoaks the ground. At first , new redcaps looklike tiny bloodstained mushrooms just push-ing their caps out of the soil. When moonlightshines on one of these caps, a creature thatresembles a wizened and undersized gnome witha hunched back and a sinewy frame springs fromthe earth. The creature has a pointed leather cap ,clothing of similar material , heavy iron boots, anda heavy bladed weapon. From the moment redcapsawaken, they desire only murder and carnage, andthey constantly seek to satisfy these cravings.Redcaps lack subtlety. They live for direct con -frontation and the mayhem of mortal combat. Evenif a redcap wanted to be stealthy, the creature'siron boots force them to take ponderous, thunder-ous steps. When a redcap is near potential prey,though , they can close the distance quickly and getin a vicious swing of their weapon before the targetcan react.Redcaps' desire to slay is rooted in their will tosurvive. To sustain their unnatural existence, theymust soak their hats in the fresh blood of their vic-tims. When redcaps are born , their hats are coatedwith wet blood, and they know that if the blood isn'treplenished at least once every three days, they willvanish as if they had never been.Some redcaps can sense the being whose murder-ous acts led to their birth. They typically use this in-nate connection to find their creator and make thatcreature their first victim, though they might insteadseek out their maker to enjoy proximity to a kindredspirit. Although redcaps don't usually operate ingroups , an individual responsible for the creationof multiple redcaps at the same site could attractthe entire group to serve as cohorts, emulating thatindividual's murderous handiwork . Some hags andwicked mages know methods to call redcaps out ofthe Feywild and m ight likewise put teams of themto work as grisly servants.In any case, if a redcap works with another being,the redcap demands to be paid in victims. A patronwho tries to stifle a redcap's natural and neces-sary urge for blood risks becoming the redcap'snext target.208 CHAPTER 2 I BESTIARYREDCAPSmall Fey, Typically Chaotic E~i/Armor Class 14 (natural armor)Hit Points 45 (6d6 + 24)Speed 25 ft .STR18 (+4)DEX13 (+l)CON18 (+4)Skills Athletics +6 , Perception +3INT10 (+O)WIS12 (+l)Senses darkvision 60 ft ., passive Perception 13Languages Common , SylvanCHA9 (-1)Challenge 3 (700 XP) Proficiency Bonus +2Iron Boots.

They were brought to that realmin ages past, so long ago that they're now adaptedto its cheerless environment, both physicallyand mentally.Eons of exposure to the influence of the Shadow-fell has left shadar -kai often joyless and mournful.In that realm, they have pale hair, wrinkled grayskin, and swollen joints that give them a corpse-like aspect. They appear more youthful while onother planes, but their skin always retains a deathlyashen hue. When in the Shadowfell, they detest mir-rors and avoid keeping things that remind them oftheir age.Shadar-kai of the Raven Queen watch over boththe Shadowfell and the Material Plane , scouting outchoice souls and tragedies that might please theirdeity. They are rumored to be able to coax worldlyevents along tragic paths for her amusement. TheRaven Queen is famously cryptic even to her mostdevoted followers, however; their efforts are re-warded only with vague omens they interpret asbest they can.212 CHAPTER '2 I BESTIARYFORTRESS OF MEMORIESThe shadar-kai who are most devoted to the RavenQueen serve her at the Fortress of Memories, hertwisted castle in the Shadowfell. The fortress is amournful place, filled with incessant echoes of thepast. Flocks of ravens that act as the Raven Queen'seyes and ears darken the skies around it when theyemerge from within, bearing her cryptic messagesand omens far and wide across the multiverse.Within the fortress are items that the RavenQueen finds irresistible: objects invested with deepfeelings of sorrow, longing, or remorse. These itemsare brought to her as gifts from the shadar-kai,and include furniture, clocks, mirrors, jewels, andtoys. Ghostly visions of people, places, and petsalso appear in the fortress. Any of these things canspontaneously appear about her lair, every objectand apparition being a metaphoric representation ofsome story- great or small - that was saturated withraw emotion.Shadar-kai encountered outside the Shadowfellare often on quests to find the most sorrow-toucheditems they can find to bring back to their queen'sgloomy castle.GLOOM WEAVERAlthough they're formidable warriors, gloom weav-ers are often content to hide in the shadows, watch-ing as their very presence affects their victims.Their bleak energy weighs down the h ea rt , causingthose nearby to feel the approach of death.

Theslithering tracker can grapple only one target at a time.Wh ile grappling the target, the sl ithering tracker takes onlyhalf any damage dealt to it (rounded down), and the targettakes the other half.BONUS ACTIONSWatery Stealth. If underwater, the slither in g tracker takes theHide action, and it makes the Dexterity (Stealth) check withadvantage.SLITHERING TRACKERThe quest for revenge sometimes leads those terri-bly aggrieved to undergo a ritual whereby they trans-form into bodies of semiliquid sentience known asslithering trackers. Innocuous and insidious at thesame time, a slithering tracker flows into placeswhere a normal creature can't go and brings its ownbrand of watery death down on its quarry.The ritual for creating a slithering tracker isknown to hags, liches, and priests who worshipgods of vengeance. It can be performed only on awilling creature that hungers for revenge. The ritualsucks all the moisture from the subject's body, kill-ing it. Yet the subject's mind lives on in the puddlethat issues forth from the remains, and so too doesits insatiable need for retribution.A slithering tracker tast es the ground it coursesover, seeking any trace of its prey. To kill, a slither-ing tracker rises up and enshrouds a creature, at-tempting to drown the creature while also drainingit of blood.Achieving revenge against its target doesn't end aslithering tracker's existence or its hunger for blood.Some slithering trackers remain aware of their pur-pose and extend their quest for vengeance to others,such as anyone who supported or befriended theoriginal target. Most of the time, though, a tracker'smind can't cope with being trapped in liquid form,unable to communicate , and driven by the desire forblood; after fulfilling its duty, the overwhelmed crea-ture attacks indiscriminately until it is destroyed.CHAPTER 2 I BESTIARY 221SORROWSWORNThe Shadowfell's pervasive melancholy sometimesgives rise to strange incarnations of the plane'sbleak nature.

Beyond the best-known planes ofexistence lie realms alien to mortal life. Some areso hostile that even a moment's contact is enough tobreak a mortal's mind. Yet beings do exist that arenative to these realms: entities that are ever hunger-ing, searching, warring, and sometimes dreaming .These Elder Evils are far older than most of themortal peoples and always inimical to such crea-tures' minds.However much they might desire to enter anddominate the Material Plane, the Elder Evils areunable or unwilling to leave their realms. Some areimprisoned in their dim e nsions by external forces,some are inextricably bound to their home realities,and others simply can't find any way out.The creatures known as star spawn are the her-alds, servants, and soldiers of the Elder Evils, capa-ble of taking on forms that can journey to the Mate-rial Plane. They arrive most often in the wake of acomet-or perhaps this phenomenon merely signalsthat star spawn are in the vicinity and available forcommunication. When the signs are right, cultistsgather together, read aloud their blasphemous texts,and conduct the mind-searing rituals that guide starspawn into the world.ELDER EVIL BLESSINGSDisciples of certain Elder Evils can bestow super-natural gifts on those who serve that cult, includingstar spawn. The following powers are unique to spe-cific cults; typically a creature has only one.CULT OF ATROPUS, THE WORLD BORN DEADGaze of Corruption (Recharge 6). The cultist targets one crea-ture it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed ona DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 16 (3dl0) necroticdamage and be poisoned for l minute . The poisoned targetcan repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns , end-ing the effect on itself on a success.CULT OF BOREM OF THE LAKE OF BOILING MuoBorem's Embrace (1/Day). The cultist touches one creaturewithin 5 feet ofit . The target must succeed on a DC 15 De xter-ity saving throw or be coated in sticky, steaming mud. While itis coated in this way, the target's speed is halved, it can't usereactions , and it takes l 0 (3d6) fire damage at the start of eachof its turns. The effect lasts for l minute, until the cultist is in-capacitated or dies, or until the target is immersed in water.226 CHAPTER 2 I BESTIARYCULT OF HAASK, THE VOICE OF HARGUTHaask's Presence (1/Day). The cultist transforms into a Tiny,slug-like being and teleports onto the shoulder of a Human-oid that it can see within 30 feet of it. The targeted Human-oid must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or becharmed by the cultist. While the target is charmed, the cultisthas control of it on the target's next turn . At the end of thatturn, the cultist teleports to an unoccupied space it can seewithin 30 feet of it and returns to its normal form . The cultistcan't be targeted directly by any attack or other effect whileit's in the slug-like form, but it is subject to areas of effectas normal.CuLT OF THAR1zouN, THE CHAINED GooTharizdun's Spark (Recharge 6). As a bonus action , the cultisttouches a simple or martial weapon or a natural weapon, if ithas one. The next creature hit by the touched weapon mustsucceed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvan-tage on all ability checks. The affected creature can repeat thesaving throw at the end of each minute, ending the effect onitself on a success.CULT OF TYRANTHRAXUS, THE FLAMED ONERadiant Flames (1/Day). Multihued flame surrounds the cultistfor l minute, until the cultist is incapacitated or dies, or untilthe cultist extinguishes the flame (no action required). Whileinflamed, the cultist has telepathy with a range of 30 feet, andit can teleport as a bonus action up to 30 feet to an unoccupiedspace it can see. In addition, every creature that starts its turnwithin 5 feet of the cultist must make a DC 15 Dexterity savingthrow, taking 16 (3dl0) radiant damage on a failed save, or halfas much damage on a successful one.STAR SPAWN GRUEFanged and lipless, the ever-grinning, eerily staringgrue lopes about on spindly legs and long arms.Bristles and spines project from odd patches ofits grayish skin, and its long fingers end in bro-ken and dirty nails. Grues are the weakest of thestar spawn. A host of writhing, scrambling gruestypically accompanies more powerful star spawn.Their constant chittering and shrieking producediscordant psychic energy that disrupts thought pat-terns in other creatures, which experience flashingcolors, hallucinations, disorientation, and waves ofhopelessness.STAR SPAWN HULKThe hulk is one of the largest of the known starspawn, with glistening, translucent skin.

Female steeders grow larger andstronger than males, and the female often devoursthe male after breeding. Numerous Underdark folkdomesticate steeders, particularly duergar (also inthis book). Typically the females serve as steeds inbattle, while the males are used as draft animals.Steeders attempt to tear apart perceived threats -and consider even other steeders enemies. Whenthey're put to work, their handlers must stable themseparately from one another and place blinders onthem to keep them from attacking each other.Steeders are intelligent enough tolearn simple hand signals and vocalcommands , but even a domesticatedsteeder might turn against its handler.Training a steeder requires a riderto bond with it, a process that beginsshortly after the steeder hatches. As itgrows, its rider works with it to directits predatory instincts.Rather than spinning webs, steed-ers excrete a viscous substance fromtheir legs. This goo allows them tocreep along walls and ceilings and tograpple prey.FEMALE STEEDERLarge Monstrosity, UnalignedArmor Class 14 (natural armor)Hit Points 30 (4dl0 + 8)Speed 30 ft ., climb 30 ft.STR15 (+2)DEX16 (+3)CON14 (+2)Skills Stealth +7 , Perception +4INT2 (-4)WIS10 (+O)Senses darkvision 120 ft ., passive Perception 14Languages-CHA3 (- 4)Challenge 1 (200 XP) Proficiency Bonus +2Extraordinary Leap.

It wasn't alwaysheadquartered in the City of Doors, however. On itsoriginal home, the plane of Mechanus, the ingeniousmodron was lauded for its invention- until it turnedthese creations against its superiors. Steel preda-tors wreaked havoc against the modron hierarchyuntil the rogue modron was trapped and exiled.Now it operates a shop in Sigil where, for a steepprice, anyone can commission the manufacture of asteel predator.To create a steel predator, the modron's machinemust be fed something that identifies the predator'starget, such as a lock of hair, a well-worn glove, or amuch-used weapon. The moment the newly manu-factured steel predator emerges, it bounds away insearch of its prey. It senses the location of its targetacross planar boundaries, but such detection is ac-curate only to within a thousand yards; to close theremaining distance, the steel predator locates itsprey by sight and smell.Once battle is joined, the predator ignores everyother threat to attack its target, unless other crea-tures prevent it from reaching the target. In thatcase, it does what it must to fulfill its mission.If all goes according to plan, a steel predatorslays its target and then voluntarily returns to Sigil,where it's broken down into parts that can be usedin another steel predator. Battle damage can causethis instinct to fail, however, in which case the steelpredator lingers in the area, hunting and killingother creatures that resemble its target or that sim-ply live nearby. Such rogue predators are dangerousto anyone in the vicinity.232 CHAPTER 2 I BESTIARYSTEEL PREDATORLarge Construct, Typically Lawful NeutralArmor Class 20 (natural armor)Hit Points 207 (18dl0 + 108)Speed 40 ft.STR24 (+7)DEX17 (+3)CON22 (+6)INT4 (- 3)Skills Perception +7 , Stealth +8 , Survival +7WIS14 (+2)CHA6 (- 2)Damage Resistances cold , lightning, necrotic, thunderDamage Immunities poison , psychic; bludgeoning, piercing,and slashing from nonmagical attacksCondition Immunities charmed, exhaustion, frightened,paralyzed , petrified , poisoned, stunnedSenses blindsight 30 ft ., darkvi s ion 60 ft ., passive Perception 17Languages understands Modron and the language of its ow nerbut can 't speakChallenge 16 (15 ,000 XP) Proficiency Bonus +5Mag ic Re sis tance.

If the target isa creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution savingthrow, or it begins to turn to stone and is restrained until theend of its next turn, when it must repeat the saving throw . Theeffect ends if the second save is successful; otherwise the tar -get is petrified for 24 hours .STONE CURSEDStone c urs ed are spawned through a foul alc hemi -ca l ritual performed on a Human oid that has beenturn ed to stone. The ritual, which requires a mix-ture of basilisk blood and the ashes from the burn edfeathers of a cockatrice, awakens a dim echo of th epetrified victim's spirit, animating the statue andturning it into a useful guardian.Stone cu rsed possess a malevolent drive to slaythe living, yet th ey are utterly loyal to whoever per-formed the ritual to animate them, and they obeythat being's orders to the best of the ir ability.In combat, stony claws th at drip with thick , graysludge emerge from a stone c ursed 's fingers. Thisalchemical sludge transforms those slashed by th eclaws into statues.As part of the ritual used to create a stone cursed,a fist-sized obsidian skull forms within the crea-ture's torso. The skull isn't visible while the stonecursed is active, but when it is slain, the statueshatters and the skull clatters to the ground. Be-cause it is the nexus for the alchemy used to createthese horrors, a faint echo of the original victim'smemories resonates within th e skull. A skilledmagic-wielder can attempt to extract memoriesfrom it to gain insight into the victim's past or findlore that otherwise would be lost.CRYPTIC WHISPERSEven though a creature transformed into a stonecursed is long dead, a vague whisper of their memo-ries lives on in the obsidian skull embedded withinthe stone cursed's body. At the end of a short rest, acharacter can make a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana)check to attempt to extrac t a m emo ry from the skullthat is a r es ponse to a verbal question pos ed to theskull by the character. Once this check is mad e,whether it succeeds or fails, the skull ca n't be usedin this manner again.CHAPTER 2 I BESTIARY 233STONE GIANTDREAMWALKERThe surface of the world is an alien realm to stonegiants: fluctuating, temporary, exposed to gustingwind and sudden rain. It is as wildly changeab le asa dream, and that's how they regard it- as a dream.Nothing there is permanent, so nothing there isreal. What happens on the surface doesn't matter.Promises and bargains made there needn't be hon-ored. Life and even art hold less value there.Stone giants sometimes go on dream quests inthe surface world, seeking inspiration for their art,a break from decades-long ennui, or satisfaction ofsimple curiosity. Some who go on these quests letthemselves become lost in the dream. Other stonegiants are banished to the surface as punishment.Regardless of the reason they ended up on thesurface, if they don't take shelter under stone, suchstone giants can become dreamwalkers.Dreamwalkers occupy an odd place of respect out-side the stone giant ordning. They are consideredoutcasts, but their familiarity with the surface wor ldmakes them valuable guides, and their insights canhelp other stone giants grasp the dangers of livingin a dream.(4 CHAPTER 2 I BESTIARYDreamwalkers become divorced from reality byisolation, shame, and their unendingly alien sur-roundings, and this delirium leaches out into theworld around them, affecting other creatures thatget too close. Believing that they're living in a dreamand that their actions have no real consequences,dreamwalkers act as they please, becoming forcesof chaos . As they travel the world, they co ll ect ob-jects and creatures that seem especially significantto them. Over time, the collected things accrete totheir bodies, becoming encased in stone.STONE GIANT DREAMWALKERHu ge Giant, Typically Chaotic NeutralArmor Class 18 (natural armor)Hit Points 161 (14dl2 + 70)Speed 40 ft.STR23 (+6)DEX14 (+2)CON21 (+5)INT10 (+0)Saving Throws De x +6, Con +9, Wis +3Skills Athletic s+ 14 , Perception +3WIS8 (-1)Condition Immunities charmed, frightenedSenses darkvision 60 ft., passive Pe rce ption 13Languages Common, GiantCHA12 (+l)Challenge 10 (5,900 XP) Proficiency Bonus +4Dreamwalker's Charm.

The giant vanishes, dis-persing itself into the storm surrounding its lair. The giantcan end this effect at the start of an y of its turns, becominga giant once more and appearing in any location it chooseswithin its lair. While dispersed , the giant can 't take any ac-tions other than lair actions, and it can't be targeted by at-tacks , spells , or other effect s. The giant can't use this abilityoutside its lair, nor can it use this ability if another creatureis using a control weather spell or similar magic to quellthe storm .STORM GIANT QUINTESSENTTo forestall the inevitable, some storm giants ap-proaching the end of their natural life spans seek anescape from death. They plumb the depths of theirpowerful conn ection to the elements and dispersethemselv es into natur e, transforming into semicon -scious storms. The blizzard that rages unendinglyaround a mountain peak , the vortex that swirlsaround a remote island, or the thunderstorm thathowls ceaselessly up and down a rugged c oastlinecould, in fact , be the undying form of a storm giantclinging to existence.A storm giant quintessent sheds their armor andweapons but gains the power to form makeshiftweapons out of thin air. When the giant has no fur-ther use of these elemental weapons , or wh en thegiant dies, the weapons disappear.A storm giant quintess ent can reve rt to their truegiant form temporarily and can maint a in that formlong enough for th e giant to c ommunicat e with amortal , ca rr y out a short task, or defe nd their homea gainst aggr e ssors . ICHAPTER 2 I BESTIARY 235A UINTESSENT'S LAIRA storm giant quintessent has no need for castlesor dungeon lairs. Their lair is usually a secludedregion or prominent geographic feature, such as amountain peak, a great waterfall, a remote island, afog-shrouded loch, a beautiful coral reef, or a wind-swept desert bluff. The storm in which the giantlives could be a blizzard, a typhoon, a thunderstorm,or a sandstorm, as befits the environment.LAIR ACTIONSA storm giant quintessent can use lair actions in gi-ant form and while transformed into a storm. On ini-tiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the giant cantake one of the following lair actions; the giant can'ttake the same lair action two rounds in a row:Deafening Boom. The giant creates a thunderclapcentered on a point anywhere in their lair. Eachcreature within 20 feet of that point must succeedon a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be deaf-ened until the end of its next turn.Fog. The giant creates a 20-foot-radius sphere offog (or murky water if within water) centered ona point anywhere in its lair. The sphere spreadsaround corners, and its area is heavily obscured.The fog lasts until the giant disperses it (no actionrequired), and it can't be dispersed by wind.23 6 CHAPTER 2 I BESTIARYGale. The giant creates a 60-foot-long, 10-foot-wideline of strong wind (or strong current within wa-ter) originating from a point anywhere in its lair.Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC18 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet inthe direction the wind is blowing. The gust dis-perses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles,torches, and similar unprotected flames in itsarea. Protected flames, such as those of lanterns,have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.REGIONAL EFFECTSThe region containing a storm giant quintessent'slair is warped by the giant's presence , which createsone or more of the following effects:Downpour. Rain, snow, or blowing dust or sand(whichever is most appropriate) is constant within1 mile of the lair. Rain causes rivers and streamsto fill or overflow their banks; snow, dust, or sandforms deep drifts or dunes.Lightning. Flashes of lightning and peals of thun-der are continual, day and night, within 5 milesof the lair.Winds. High wind blows within 1 mile of the lair,making it impossible to light a fire unless the loca-tion where the fire is lit is protected from the wind.If the giant dies, the lightning, thunder, and highwind regional effects end immediately. Rain, snow,and blowing dust abate gradually within ld8 days.tSWARM OF ROT GRUBSRot grubs ar e finger-sized maggots that e at livingand dead cre atures, although they c an survive onvegetation.

What-ever process is used corrupts the subject, transform-ing them into a vicious Fiend.Although tanarukks are valued as fearsome fight-ers, they are a threat to their allies off the battlefield.When not in combat, a tanarukk is destructive andvolatile and is usually kept imprisoned by its allies.If unrestrained, a free tanarukk embarks on a ram-page, attempting to take over by force. Most suchcoups fail but are costly nonetheless. If a tanarukkdoes seize the leadership of a group, reckless raid-ing or even war is the course they inevitably choose.TITIVILUSDispat e r, th e gloomy Lord of Dis , rules from his ironpalace, seeming to hide behind its labyrinthine cor-ridors, iron walls, diabolical traps , and monstrousservants.

These desert creatures range acrossarid lands , hunting at dawn and dusk. In thehours between, they wait out the day's heat orthe night's cold by burying themselves in loosesand or earth or, if the terrain proves too inflexi-ble, lurking in ruins or shallow caves.Tlincallis stay in one place for only as long as thehunting is good in the immediate area, though theymight visit the same way stations over and overduring their wanderings. They also settle down tem-porarily whenever it's time to lay eggs and hatch anew brood of young.These scorpion folk deposit their eggs in warmplaces out of direct sunlight, often amid a stand ofcacti near their present encampment. The eggs areprotected by hard shells coated in paralytic poisonsimilar to that produced by their stingers. Thispoison leaves most would-be predators that dare tobreak an egg defenseless when the tlincalli parentscome to investigate.Tlincallis eat what they kill, whether their huntnets desert animals or a caravan, but when theyhave new mouths to feed, they are careful to takesome of their prey alive. After using their stingersto paralyze victims and their spiked chains to bindthem, tlincallis take these captives back to their en-campment and tie them to cact i or rock formations.When the Â·sun sets, the newly hatched young emergefrom the lair to eat the captives alive.These predators see themselves as great hunters,and respect others with such skills. If a tlincalliencou nters a more powerful hunter, such as a bluedragon, they carefully weigh whether to serve thesuper ior hunter, move on, or fight to the death to re -move it as competition.Tlincallis rarely build cities, make clothing, ormine metals. Instead, they scavenge much of whatthey need or want. They do, however, melt downscavenged metal to forge crude weapons, armor,and tools.'TLINCALLILarge Monstrosity , Typically NeutralArmor Class 15 (natural armor)Hit Points 85 (l 0dl 0 + 30)Speed 40 ft.STR16 (+3)DEXl3 (+l)CON16 (+3)INT8 (- 1)WIS12 (+l)Skills Perception +4, Stealth +4, Survival +4Senses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 14Languages TlincalliCHA8 (-1)Challenge 5 (1,800 XP) Proficiency Bonus +3ACTIONSMultiattack.

If the trapper is motionless on a floor, wa ll,or ce iling at the start of combat, it has advantage on its in itia -TRAPPERA trapper is a manta-like creature that usually lurksin subterranean environments. It can change thecolor and texture of its tough, outward-facing side tohelp it blend in with its surroundings, while its soft,inward-facing side clings to the floor, wall, or ceilingin its hunting territory. It re mains motionless as itwaits for prey to come close. When a target is withinits reach , it peels itself away from the surface andwraps around its prey, crushing, smothering, andthen dig es ting it. Only a scattering of bones, metal ,treasur e, and other indigestible bits is left behind.A trapp e r's ability to alter the color and texture ofits outer side enables it to blend in with any surfa cemad e of stone, ear th, or wood, masking its presenceto any but the most rigorous scrutiny. It can't c hang eits texture to that of a grassy or snow-covered sur-face, but it is just cunning e nough to cha nge its colorto mat ch and then conc ea l itself under a thin layer ofvegetation or actual snow.A trapp er that lurks on the fl oor of its huntinggrounds ca n cover any re mains th ere with its body,making them look like irregularities in the surface.Th e creature might instead attach itself to a n ea rbywall or a ceiling, using th e remnants as bait; anycreature that stops to inv est igate the bones for valu-ab les becomes the trapper's next meal.A trapp er needs to eat a halfling-siz ed meal onceper week to remain sated. Given a steady supply offood, trapp e rs are content to stay in one place, mak-ing them a threat along well-traveled dungeon corri-dor and on routes through the wilderness that see alot of traffic. When prey is scarce, a trapper enters astate of hibernation that can last for months , thoughit is still aware when prey comes near. A trapper onthe verge of starvation might defy its instincts andabandon its old territory in search of better hunting.ti ve ro ll.

Radically transformed trolls like therot trolls, spirit trolls, and venom trolls that followare especially likely to arise when trolls regener-ate in the presence of magical emanations, planarenergy, disease, or death on a vast scale, or if theirbodies were damaged by elemental forces.

Vaprak'strue nature is something of a mystery, but Vaprak isalways portrayed as a horrid, misshapen, greenishcreature strongly resembling a troll. Vaprak is givento fits of mindless destruction and uncontrollablyfears the plots and ambitions of other deities.Vaprak's troll worshipers believe this god devoursthe souls of those who have been cooked or digested(slain by fire or acid). Otherwise, the god spits thesoul back into the world to regenerate a new body.DIRE TROLLTrolls kill and eat almost anything - including, inrare cases, other trolls. This cannibalism has theeffect of causing a troll to grow to an unusually largesize. The resulting dire trolls crave more and moretroll flesh to fuel their continued growth.Dire trolls also increase their size by graftingflesh onto themselves. When a slab of quivering trollflesh is bound against a fresh wound on a dire troll,the dire troll's regenerative capacity incorporatesthe new mass into the troll's own musculature. Evenmore horrifying are the multiple arms, eyes, claws,and organs that dire trolls tear from their victimsand graft onto themselves in this manner.RoTTROLLLarge Giant , Typi ca lly Chaotic EvilArmor Class 16 (natural armor)Hit Points 138 (12dl0 + 72)Speed 30 ft.STR18 (+4)DEX13 (+l)Skills Percept ion +3CON22 (+6)Damage Immunities necrot icINT5 (-3)WIS8 (-1)Senses darkv ision 60 ft. , pass iv e Per cept ion 13Languages GiantCHA4 (-3)Challenge 9 (5,000 XP) Proficiency Bonus +4Rancid Degeneration.

Illithids innately recognize that an ulitharid'ssurvival is more important than their own. An elderbrain's reaction to the rise of an ulitharid varies.In most colonies, the ulitharid becomes an elderbrain's most favored servant, invested with powerand authority. In oth ers, the elder brain perceivesan ulitharid as a potential rival and ma nipulates orquashes the ulitharid 's ambitions accordingly.When an ulitharid finds sharing leadership withan elder brain insufferable, it breaks off from thecolony, taking a group of mind flayers with it, andmoves to another location to form a new colony.N t er_ the death of th e ulitharid's body, a special pro-cess transforms its brain into a new elder brain forthe colony.This process doesn 't work on the brain of an uli-tharid that dies a natural death, as such brains aretoo decrepit to be used. Instead, each ulitharid car-ries a psionically enhanced staff; when the ulitharidis ready to give up its life, it attaches the staff to theback of its head, and th e staff cracks open its skull,enabling its brain to be e xtra cted. Th e brain and thest a ff ar e th en planted in the ulitha rid's c orps e, caus-ing it to dis solve into ic hor .

Indistinguishable from the miststhey lurk within , they strike unseen and undetectedto bleed their victims dry.Vampiric mists, sometimes called crimson mists,are all that remain of vampires who couldn't returnto their burial places after being defeated or suf-fering some mishap. Denied the restorative powerof these places, the vampires' bodies dissolve intomist. The transformation strips the intelligence andpersonality from them until only an unholy, insatia-ble thirst for blood remains.Indistinguishable from fog aside from the charnelreek it exudes, a vampiric mist descends on a crea-ture and causes the blood in the creature's bodyto ooze through its pores or spill out from its eyes,nose , and mouth. This blood wafts out from thevictim like crimson smoke, which the mist then con-sumes. The feeding causes no pain or discomfort tothe victim, so vampiric mists can feed on sleeperswithout waking them. The more a mist feeds , theredder it gets, such that it turns pink, then red , andfinally a deep scarlet hue; when sated, it rains blooddroplets wherever it goes.Like sharks in water, vampiric mists can scentblood from up to a mile away. Any injury, no matterhow small, might catch their attention and drawthem toward their victims. In battle, a mist focusesits attacks on injured targets, since open woundsare a more ready source of blood.VAMPIRIC MISTMedium Undead, Typically Chaotic E~ilJrmor Class 13Hit Points 30 (4d8 + 12)Speed Oft. , fly 30 ft .

They are given little regardby powerful and intelligent demons since vargouillescan do them no harm. Even the weakest demon,such as a manes or a dretch , fears vargouilles only ifthey appear in great numbers. In the Lower Planes,vargouilles rarely get the chance to eat live preyother than vermin. More often, they lap up the ichorleft behind when one Fiend kills another .Because of their hunger for living prey, vargouillesare eager to escape the Lower Planes. On rare oc-casions, summoning a demon to another plane canbring a vargouille along for the ride, attached likea tick. The precautions a mortal takes to control asummoned demon rarely account for a stowaway,enabling the vargouille to escape into the world.Vargouilles that roam free on the Material Planeare a dire threat to all creatures. Their awfulshrieking can paralyze other creatures with fear,which also makes the creatures susceptible to thevargouille's curse. If the curse is allowed to run itscourse, an abyssal spirit invades the person's body,causing a gruesome transformation. Over a periodof hours, the victim's head takes on fiendish aspects,such as fangs, tentacles, and horns. At the sametime, the person's ears grow larger, expanding intowing-like appendages. In the final moments, thevictim's head tears away from the body in a fountainof blood, becoming another vargouille, which oftenthen eagerly laps up the blood spilling from its for-mer body. Sunlight or the brilliant illumination of adaylight sp e ll can delay this transformation; other-wise, only magic can overcome the curse.VARGOUILLETiny Fi end, Typically Chaotic EvilArmor Class 12Hit Points 18 (4d4 + 8)Speed 5 ft ., fly 40 ft .STR6 (-2)DEX14 (+2)CON14 (+2)INT4 (-3)Damage Resistances cold, fire, lightningDamage Immunities poisonCondition Immunities poisonedWIS7 (-2)Senses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 8CHA2 (-4)Languages understands Abyssal , Infernal , and any languages itknew before becoming a vargouille but can 't speakChallenge 1 (200 XP) Proficiency Bonus +2ACTIONSBite.

Also called moldfolk or moldies, vegepygmies inhabit dark, moist ar-eas, so they're most commonly found undergroundor in forests where little sunlight penetrates. A vege-pygmy feels kinship with other plant and funguscreatures, and thus vegepygmy bands coexist wellwith creatures such as myconid adults, shriekers,and violet fungi (all appear in the Monster Manual).Although they prefer to eat fresh meat, bone, andblood, vegepygmies can absorb nutrients from soiland many sorts of organic matter, so they rarelygo hungry. A vegepygmy can hiss and make othernoises by forcing air through its mouth, but it can'tspeak in a conventional sense. Among themselves,vegepygmies communicate by hissing, gestures, andtapping. Vegepygmies build and craft little; any gearthey have is acquired from other creatures or builtby copying simple construction they have witnessed.VEGEPYGMYTypical vegepygmies originate from the remainsleft behind when a Humanoid or a Giant is killed byrusset mold (see "Russet Mold" below). One or morevegepygmies emerge from the corpse a day later.VEGEPYGMY CHIEFAs a vegepygmy ages, it grows tougher and developsspore clusters on its body. Other vegepygmies deferto th e se so-called chiefs. A chief can expel its sporesin a burst , infecting nearby creatures. If a creaturedies while infected, its corpse produces vegepyg-mies the same way russet mold does .THORNY VEGEPYGMYIf-a Beast such as a dog or a bear dies from russetmdld, the result is a bestial moldy called a thorny,instead of a bipedal vegepygmy. Thornies are less in-telligent than other vegepygmies, but they are largerand more ferocious and have thorn-covered bodies.RUSSET MOLDFew know for sure where russet mold came from.One historical account tells of adventurers in amountain range discovering russet mold and vege-pygmies in a peculiar metal dungeon full of strangelife. Another story says that explorers found russetmold in a crater left by a falling star, with vegepyg-mies infesting th e fore st nearby.Th e mold is found only in pla ces that ar e dark,wa rm, a nd wet. Ru sse t mold that s pr ea ds out acro ssa metal object ca n be mistaken for ru s t, and a su c-ces sful DC 15 Intelligence (Natur e) or Wisdom (Sur-viva l) ch ec k is re quir ed to identify it.252 C HAPTER 2 I BEST I A RYEFFECTS OF THE MOLDAny creature that comes within 5 feet of russet moldmust make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw asthe mold emits a puff of spores. On a failed save, thecreature is poisoned. While poisoned in this way,the creature takes 7 (2d6) poison damage at thestart of each of its turns. The creature can repeatthe saving throw at the end of each of its turns, end-ing the effect on itself on a success. Any magic thatneutralizes poison or cures disease kills the infesta-tion. A creature reduced to O hit points by the molddies. If the dead creature is a Beast, a Giant, or aHumanoid, one or more vegepygmies emerge fromits body 24 hours later: one from a Small corpse,two from a Medium corpse, four from a Largecorpse , eight from a Huge corpse, or sixteen from aGargantuan corpse.DE STROYING THE MOLDRusset mold can be hard to kill, since weapons andmost types of damage do it no harm. Effects thatdeal acid, necrotic, or radiant damage kill 1 squarefoot of russet mold per 1 damage dealt. A poundof salt, a gallon of alcohol, or magic that cures dis-ease kills russet mold in a square area that is 10feet on a side. Sunlight kills any russet mold in thelight's area.f ; ?#S=::n p.::::;..; Â·c - -=== -VEGEPYGMYSmall Plant, Typically NeutralArmor Class 13 (natu ral armor)Hit Points 13 (3d6 + 3)Speed 30 ft.STR7 (- 2)DEX14 (+2 )CON13 (+l)Sk ills Perception +2, Stealth +4INT6 (-2)WIS11 (+O)Damage Resistances lightn ing, piercingSenses dar kv ision 60 ft ., pass iv e Pe rception 12Languages Veg e py gmyCHA7 (-2)Challenge 1/4 (50 X P) Proficiency Bonus +2Plant Camouflage.

Perform-ing the ritual isn't necessarily an evil act if the vic-tim-to-be is a willing sacrifice.In the ritual, a living person's chest is pierced andthe heart removed. A seed is pushed into the heart,which is then placed in a tree. Any hollow or crookwill do, but often a special cavity is carved out ofthe trunk. The tree is bathed and watered with theblood of the sacrificed victim, and the body is buriedamong the tree's roots. After three days, a sproutemerges from the ground at the base of the tree andswiftly grows into a bipedal form.This new body, armored in tough bark and bear-ing a gnarled club and shield, is at once ready to per-form its duty. The one who performed the ritual setsthe wood woad to its task , and the creature followsthose orders unceasingly.A wood woad has a hole where its heart would be,just as does the body of its former self, buried in theearth. Those who become wood woads trade theirfree will and all sense of sentiment for supernaturalstrength and a deathless duty. They exist only toprotect woodlands and the people who tend them. Awood woad's face is void and expressionless, exceptfor the motes of light that swim about in its eye sock-ets. Wood woads speak little, and when not calledon to take action, they root themselves in the earthand silently take sustenance from it.Like trees, wood woads need only sunlight, air,and nutrients from the earth to go on living. Be-cause they are undying, some wood woads outlivetheir original purpose. The site a wood woad guardsmight lose its power or significance over time, orthose whom it was assigned to guard might die. If itis freed from its specific duties, a wood woad mightroam to find another place of natural beauty or feyinfluence to watch over.Wood woads are drawn to creatures that haveclose ties to nature and that protect and respect theland, such as druids and treants (both appear in theMonster Manual). Some treants have wood woadservants by virtue of age-old pacts with druids orFey that performed the rituals, while others acquirethe services of freed wood woads that find renewedpurpose in serving a kindred guardian.XVARTSXvarts are cowardly, greedy creatures spawned bya renegad e demigod, Raxivort. They have blue skin ,orange eyes, and receding hairlines, mirroring theircreator's appearance. Th ey stand about 3 feet tall.Raxivort spent centuries watching over the trea-sury of Graz'zt (appears in this book), and in time ,Raxivort plundered his lord's vault. One of the trea-sures he stole was the Infinity Spindl e, a crystallineshard that could transform even a creature as lowlyas Raxivort into a demigod. After his apotheosis,Raxivort forged the Black Sewers, a r ea lm withinPandemonium that he filled with his beloved crea-tures , rats and bats, which xvarts befriend to thisday.

Once a yagno-loth is hired, it communicates its employer's desiresto the yugoloths it commands.Although they are entruste d with leading lesseryugoloths, yagnoloths ultimately take their ordersfrom arcanaloths and ultroloths. Aside from theirsuperiors, yagnoloths have full authority over andexpect obedience from the yugoloths under theircommand. Yagnoloths follow the dictates of the con-tracts they negotiate but always include a loopholeto escape their obligations if the situation warrants.A yagnoloth has one arm of human size and onegiant-sized arm. During negotiations, the yagnolothuses its human-sized arm to draft and sign con-tracts.

Yeenoghu is the GnollLord, and his creations are made in his twistedimage. When the demon lord hunted across the Ma-terial Plane, packs of hyenas followed in his wake,and those that ate of great Yeenoghu's kills becamegnolls.. Few others worship the Beast of Butchery,but those who do tend to take on a gnoll-like aspect,hunching over and filing their teeth down to points.Yeenoghu wants nothing more than slaughterand senseless destruction. Gnolls are his favoriteinstruments, and he drives his gnoll followers toever-greater atrocities in his name, even imbuingsome of their commanders with his powers, whichtransforms them into flinds (in this book). Yeenoghutakes pleasure in causing fear before death, and hesows sorrow and despair through destroying be-loved things. He doesn't parlay; to meet him is to dobattle with him-unless he becomes bored and wan-ders away. The Beast of Butchery has a long rivalrywith Baphomet, the Horned King (appears in thisbook), and the two demon lords and their followersattack one another on sight..,. .â€¢ _The Gnoll Lord is covered in matted fur and leath-ery hide, and his face resembles a grinning preda-tor's skull. He wields a triple-headed flail called theButcher, which he can summon into his hand at will,although he is as likely to tear his prey apart withhis teeth.YEENOGHU'S LAIRYeenoghu's lair in the Abyss is called the DeathDells. Its barren hills and ravines serve as a huntingground, where he pursues captured mortals in acruel game. Yeenoghu's lair is a place of blood anddeath, populated by gnolls, hyenas, and ghouls (see _the Monster Manual), and there are few structuresor signs of civilization on his layer of the Abyss.The challenge rating of Yeenoghu is 25 (75,000XP) when he's encountered in his lair.LAIR ACTIONSOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Yeeno-ghu can take one of the following lair actions; hecan't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:Incite the Pack. Until the next initiative count 20,all gnolls and hyenas within the lair are enraged,causing them to have advantage on melee weaponattack rolls and causing attack rolls to have advan-tage against them. ICHAPTER 2 I BESTIARY 269Iron Spike. Yeenoghu causes an iron spike-5 feettall and 1 inch in diameter-to burst from theground at a point he can see within 100 feet ofhim. Any creature in the space where the spikeemerges must make a DC 24 Dexterity savingthrow. On a failed save, the creature takes 27(6d8) piercing damage and is restrained by beingimpaled on the spike.

The transformation process warps notonly a subject's body but also their mind, makingthem instinctively obey any yuan-ti and filling themwith a seething rage at the sight of non-reptiliancreatures.Although broodguards can no longer think asclearly as before their transformation, they are ableto perform simple yet important tasks in the com-munity, such as guarding eggs or patrolling for in-truders. Yuan-ti refer to broodguards as "histachii,"which means "egg-watchers."'--- Most broodguards are made from human captivesforced to consume a magical brew that rendersthem helpless and unable to fight off the inevitabletransformation. A human transformed into a brood-guard loses all semblance of who they once were.A broodguard is hairless and emaciated, with scalyskin. They have a forked tongue, and they smellfaintly of rotting meat. Broodguards can speak butrarely do so, preferring to communicate via snake -like hisses and guttural noises.MAKING A BROODGUARDYuan-ti create broodguards from captured Human-oids. Each subject is fed a special potion that im-mediately renders it incapacitated and transformsit into a broodguard over the next ld6 + 6 days.

To k eep Bel busy and out of he r sight, Zarieltasks him with forging weapons, armor, and grue-some demon-slaying machines.To replenish her legions, Zariel n eeds the souls ofmortals to create lemur es, which she can then pro-mote to higher forms of devils.
