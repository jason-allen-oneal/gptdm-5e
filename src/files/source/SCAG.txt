SWORD COAST 
ADVENTURER’S GUIDE  


Preface 


HAIL AND WELL MET, TRAVELER! WELCOME 
 to a world of magic and adventure. Originally created by Ed Greenwood, the Forgotten Realms setting has been home to 
 Dungeons & Dragons stories and games 
 for decades. Built for tales of swords and 
sorcery, the Realms initially grew and 
flourished in Ed’s D&D campaign, which featured he- 
roes like the Knights of Myth Drannor in the Dalelands. 
Ed also shared glimpses of the Realms in the pages of 
Dragon magazine, giving D&D players their first tales 
from the wizard Elminster, the old sage of Shadowdale, 
who occasionally found his way through a portal be- 
tween Faerun and our world and into Ed’s living room. 



When TSR, the company that owned D&D at the 
time, sought a new campaign world to expand the D&D 
multiverse, they chose the Forgotten Realms, and in 
1987, the gates were flung wide for players and Dungeon 
Masters all over the world to come to Faerun and create 
their own heroic tales. A year later, author R.A. Salva- 
tore introduced readers to the adventures of the drow 
outcast Drizzt Do’Urden in his first novel, The Crystal 
Shard , establishing the Underdark as an essential part 
of the Realms. 

In the years since, the Forgotten Realms have played 
host to a vast number of game products, novels, video 
games, and more, making it one of the most widely vis- 
ited fantasy settings ever created. The lost portals to the 
Realms have returned and remained open in the depths 
of our imaginations and do so to this day, as more and 
more visitors find their way there. 

It is no surprise, then, that the Forgotten Realms be- 
came the setting for the first adventures for fifth edition 
Dungeons & Dragons. Already, new heroes have accom- 
plished great deeds and saved Faerun from terrible evil 
and will continue to do so, as long as the flame of imagi- 
nation draws them there. 

This book is further fuel for the fire sparked by those 
adventures and the glimpses of the Realms you can find 
in the fifth edition Player's Handbook , Dungeon Masters 
Guide , and Monster Manual. It gives you a broad look at 
the continent of Faerun and the world of Toril in general, 
and the regions of the Sword Coast and the North in 
particular. 

In these pages, you’ll learn about the history, lands, and 
peoples of Faerun, of the great city-states of the Sword 
Coast and the North, of the world’s gods, and of the fac- 
tions and forces that support and threaten civilization. 
Chapter 1 of this book gives an overview of the Sword 
Coast and nearby lands, its history, the role of magic, and 
its religions. Chapter 2 goes into detail about the cities 
and other locations of the Sword Coast. Chapter 3 gives 
history and some game material for various races and 
subraces, both common and uncommon, that can be met 
on the Sword Coast and in the North. Chapter 4 shows 
how the character options in the Player's Handbook fit 
into this region and presents new character class options 
specific to the Forgotten Realms. Chapter 5 gives back- 
grounds designed to link your characters to the great 
places, people, and events of Faerun. 

While the body of Realms lore is vast, and this book is 
only an introduction, the Forgotten Realms setting— like 
D&D itself— is yours, and has been ever since Ed opened 
that first portal and invited us to come and visit. The 
Realms are a place to create and tell your stories, about 
your adventurers and their deeds. The lands and peoples 
of Faerun welcome you, traveler, for it is a place of peril 
sorely in need of the heroes you will bring forth. 

Go now, through the portal of imagination and into 
vast and wonderful realms awaiting beyond.

Chapter 1: Welcome to the Realms 


N THE WORLD OF TORIL, BETWEEN THE 
windswept Sea of Swords to the west 
and the mysterious lands of Kara-Tur 
to the east, lies the continent of Faerun. 

A place of varied cultures and races, 
Faerun is dominated by human lands, be 
they kingdoms, city-states, or carefully 
maintained alliances of rural communities. Interspersed 
among the lands of humans are old dwarven kingdoms 
and hidden elven enclaves, assimilated populations of 
gnomes and halflings, and more exotic folk. 

A great deal of adventure is to be had in the Realms, 
for those willing to seek it out. The routes between cities 
and nations often cross into the territory of brigands or 
marauding humanoids. Every forest, swamp, and moun- 
tain range has its own perils, whether lurking bandits, 
savage ores and goblinoids, or mighty creatures such 
as giants and dragons. Ruins dot the landscape and the 
caverns that wind beneath the surface. In these places, 
treasures of every living race— and a number of dead 
ones— wait for adventurers intrepid enough to come and 
claim them. 

Faerun is filled with rich history and wondrous tales 
of adventure and magic, but the lifeblood of its common 
people is agriculture and trade. Most rural folk depend 
on farming to eat, and Faerunians who live in cities ply 
skilled trades or use brawn to earn their keep, so they 
can purchase the goods and food provided by others. 
News and gossip are carried between population cen- 
ters by caravans and ships that bring in supplies for 
trade and by traveling bards and minstrels who recount 
i or invent) stories to inform and entertain people in tav- 
erns, inns, and castles. Adventurers also spread news- 
while also creating it! 

The common folk of Faerun look on adventurers 
with a mixture of admiration, envy, and mistrust. Folk 
believe that any stalwarts willing to risk their lives on 
behalf of complete strangers should be lauded and re- 
warded. But such adventurers, if they become success- 
ful, amass wealth and personal status at a rate that 
some people find alarming. Even people who admire 
these adventurers for their energy and their acts of 
valor might have misgivings: what horrors will be un- 
leashed if adventurers, heedless or unknowing of the 
danger, unlock a ruin or a tomb and release an ancient 
evil into the world? 

Most of the people who populate the continent have 
little or no knowledge of lands outside Faerun. The 
most educated among the populace agree that Faerun 
is but one continent and that Toril is the whole of the 
world, but for the majority of people, who don’t experi- 
ence intercontinental travel or extraplanar exploration, 
“Faerun” is more than large enough of a concept for 
them to comprehend. 

Except in the most remote or insular places, 
Faerunians are accustomed to seeing people of different 
cultures, ethnicities, and races. Only in the most cos- 
mopolitan areas does such casual acceptance extend 
to evil humanoid races— such as goblinoids, ores, and 


drow— to say nothing of even more dangerous creatures. 
Adventurers tend to be more tolerant, accepting exiles, 
misfits, and redeemed folk from strange lands and with 
unusual shapes. 

The Sword Coast and 
the North 

Running along the Sea of Swords from north of Amn 
to the Sea of Moving Ice, the Sword Coast is a narrow 
band of territory dominated by the city-states of the area 
that use the sea for trade. For most who care about such 
things, the area is delimited by Neverwinter in the north 
and Baldur’s Gate in the south, but territory farther to 
the north and south that isn’t under the sway of a more 
influential power is usually also included in maps of the 
Sword Coast. 

More broadly, the North refers to all the territory 
north of Amn, split into two general regions: the West- 
ern Heartlands and the Savage Frontier. The Western 
Heartlands encompasses a narrow strip of civiliza- 
tion running from the Sunset Mountains to the Sea 
of Swords, and northward from the band of territory 
marked by the Cloud Peaks and the Troll Mountains to 
the Trade Way. The Savage Frontier is the name given 
to the rest of the unsettled or sparsely settled territory 
in the North, not including the major cities and towns 
and any settlements in their immediate spheres of 
influence. 

Most of the communities, nations, and governments of 
the North can be grouped into five categories: the cities 
and towns that are members of the Lords’ Alliance, the 
dwarfiholds that have been built throughout the area, the 
island kingdoms off the coast, the independent realms 
scattered up and down the coast, and the subterranean 
environs of the Underdark. Each category is discussed 
briefly here: more details can be found in chapter 2. 

The Lords’ Alliance 

The Lords’ Alliance is a confederation among the rulers 
of various northern settlements. The number of mem- 
bers on the Council of Lords, the group’s governing 
body, shifts depending on the changing status of mem- 
ber cities and political tensions in the region. Currently, 
the Lords’ Alliance counts these individuals as coun- 
cil members: 

• Laeral Silverhand, the Open Lord of Waterdeep 

• Dagult Neverember, Lord Protector of Neverwinter 

• Taern Hornblade, High Mage of Silverymoon 

• Ulder Ravengard, Grand Duke of Baldur’s Gate and 
Marshal of the Flaming Fist 

• Morwen Daggerford, Duchess of Daggerford 

• Selin Ramur, Marchion of Mirabar 

• Dowell Harpell of Longsaddle 

• Dagnabbet Waybeard, Queen of Mithral Hall 

• Lord Dauner Ilzimmer of Amphail 

• Nestra Ruthiol, Waterbaron of Yartar 






CHAPTER 1 | WELCOME TO THE REALMS 





— ■ 1 — ■ 1 





The Lords’ Alliance includes the strongest mercantile 
powers of the North. In addition to providing military 
support and a forum for the peaceful airing of differ- 
ences, the Alliance has always acted under the principle 
that communities with common cause that engage in 
trade are less likely to go to war with one another. By 
maintaining strong trade ties within the alliance as well 
as outside it, the Lords’ Alliance helps to keep the peace. 


ance of cities that provided mutual protection across the 
North. Disagreements and failed obligations during a 
war with the ore kingdom of Many-Arrows destroyed the 
remaining trust between members of the Marches, and 
that pact is no more. The dwarfholds still ally with one 
another, and individually with nearby human realms, 
but no longer pledge to stand unified with all their 
neighbors. 


Dwarfholds of the North 


Island Kingdoms 


The various dwarven communities of the North are the 
heirs and survivors of Delzoun, the great Northkingdom 
of long ago. Despite continually warring over the centu- 
ries with the ores and goblinoids of the region, and hav- 
ing to fight off assaults from below by duergar and drow, 
the shield dwarves have stood fast, determined to hold 
their halls against all threats— and, when necessary, 
reclaim them. 

Holds that survive from the days of Delzoun include 
Mithral Hall, Citadel Adbar, and Citadel Felbarr. The 
fabled city of Gauntlgrym, built by the Delzoun dwarves 
and recently taken back from the drow, stands as a 
beacon of resurgent dwarven strength in the North. 
Stoneshaft Hold and Ironmaster are lonely settlements 
continually girding themselves for threats real and 
imagined. Sundabar and Mirabar are also generally 
considered dwarfholds, despite their substantial human 
populations. 

Until recently, many of the dwarfholds were members 
of the Silver Marches (also known as Luruar), an alli- 



Off the western coast of Faerun are a number of island 
realms of varying size. The most distant, and yet per- 
haps the most symbolically important to the mainland, 
is Evermeet, the island paradise of the elves, reputed to 
be a part of the divine realm of Arvandor. Much closer 
to Faerun are the Whalebones and Ruathym, ancient 
homes of the ancestors of the Illuskan people, and the 
Moonshaes, where many of those same people now 
share the islands with the Ffolk and an elf offshoot 
known as the Llewyr. The free port of Mintarn lies 
nearby, a neutral site for meetings between enemies 
and a recruitment spot that offers abundant jobs for 
sailors. Despite its size, the tiny island of Orlumbor, 
with its treacherous harbor and its skilled, in-demand 
shipwrights, is an independent and influential nation 
unto itself. 

In the seas to the south, pirates of many races and pre- 
dilections sail from the Nelanther Isles, preying on trade 
running north and south along the coasts. Since the 
beginning of the Sundering, fabled Lantan and Nimbral 
have returned. Both the center of invention and the isle 
of Leira-worshiping illusionists are even more secretive 
and less welcoming of strangers than before their dis- 
appearance. 

Independent Realms 

Interspersed among the fortresses of the dwarves and 
the settlements protected by the Lord’s Alliance are 
significant sites that have no collective character, except 
that they exist largely outside the protection or purview 
of the great powers of the region. Even the civilized 
locales among these places, such as Elturgard, exist, 
at best, in an uneasy tension with the denizens of the 
wilder lands within and just outside their borders, and 
survive only through constant vigilance and the steady 
recruitment of new defenders. 

A great variety of independent nations and notable 
locations is encompassed within the wild lands of the 
North. Among them are the great library of Candlekeep, 
home of the greatest collection of written lore in Faerun; 
the imposing, giant-scale castle of Darkhold; the forti- 
fied abbey of Helm’s Hold; sites of great battles such as 
Boareskyr Bridge and the Fields of the Dead; realms of 
some security, such as Elturgard and Hartsvale; and the 
yuan-ti realm of Najara. The lands of the Uthgardt, the 
towns of frigid Icewind Dale, the quiet Trielta Hills, the 
cutthroat city of Luskan, and the legendary Warlock’s 
Crypt, dominion of the great lich Larloch, are all inde- 
pendent realms, as are the High Moor, the Trollclaws, 
and the High Forest. 


CHAPTER 1 | WELCOME TO THE REALMS 


There is much danger and adventure to be had in the 
free places of the North, and a great deal of wealth and 
treasure as well. The ruins of ancient kingdoms and 
countless smaller settlements litter the countryside, 
waiting for the right explorers to happen upon them. 

The Underdark 

Extending miles downward and outward beneath the 
surface of Faerun, and reaching to other continents as 
well, the great network of subterranean caverns known 
as the Underdark is home to all manner of strange and 
deadly creatures. Duergar and drow— dark reflections 
of dwarves and elves— live in these sunless lands, as do 
the svirfneblin, or deep gnomes. Most surface-dwelling 
folk aren’t threatened or even disturbed by denizens 
of the deep places, but the creatures occasionally 
emerge to raid or to seek some kind of goal in the sur- 
face world. 

Among the lands of the Underdark beneath the North 
are the svirfneblin city of Blingdenstone, the duergar 
city of Gracklstugh, and the infamous drow city of Men- 
zoberranzan. Also prominent is Mantol-Derith, a trading 
post for Underdark merchants. 

Toril and Its Lands 

Toril is a vast and wondrous world, filled with an im- 
mense diversity of peoples and a rich, full history. For 
most folk of the Sword Coast, however, knowledge 
doesn’t extend much beyond the confines of the North, 
and anything “known” outside of Faerun proper is based 
more in rumor than in fact. 

Faerun 

The vast central continent of Toril, Faerun is a land 
mass divided by a great sea known as the Inner Sea, or 
the Sea of Fallen Stars. The lands beyond the North can 
be roughly divided into those to the south and those to 
the east, becoming more foreign to the folk of the Sword 
Coast and the North the farther away they are. 

Lands to the South 

To the south of the Sword Coast lie ancient nations, a 
tremendous, forbidding jungle, and all manner of lands 
destroyed or transformed by magical cataclysms and up- 
heavals. Amid the ruin and the distress in these realms 
are signs of renewal and hope, as tenacious civilizations 
and peoples rebuild, reclaim, and create anew. 

Amn . A nation led by the representatives of five noble 
families, Amn is a place where the wealthy rule, openly 
and without pretense. Shrewd traders and ruthless in 
business, Amnians believe that the end of a successful 
transaction is justified by any means, ethical or oth- 
erwise. Although the nation is richer by far than even 
the northern metropolises of Baldur’s Gate and Water- 
deep, its influence is curtailed by the unwillingness of 
its rulers to work together in the nation’s best interest. 
The members of the Council of Five are fairly unified 
and tight-fisted in their control of Amn, but their ability 
to affect events outside their own borders is limited be- 
cause they can’t agree enough on major matters of for- 
eign policy. The oligarchs utterly control their nation, 


but beyond the areas that each rules, their families and 
businesses compete with one another and with the lo- 
cals of far-flung places. 

The use of arcane magic is illegal in Amn, meaning 
that the only authorized spellcasters in the nation are 
wielders of divine magic who enjoy the support and 
patronage of a temple, and users of arcane magic who 
have been given special dispensation by one of the oli- 
garchs. So pervasive is the sway of Amn’s oligarchy that 
few crimes merit physical punishment but those that 
involve the use of arcane magic or an offense against 
one of the council’s merchant houses. Other infractions 
are forgiven after the miscreant makes payment of an 
appropriate fine. 

Calimshan . This southern land has long been the 
battleground for warring genies. After years of strug- 
gling beneath their genasi masters, human slaves arose 
to follow a Chosen of Ilmater, at first using nonviolent 
resistance, and then erupting in full rebellion following 
his disappearance. They overthrew the genie lords of 
Calimport and Memnon, casting the remaining genies 
out of the cities and back to their elemental homes or 
into the depths of the deserts. 

Much of Calimshan is a chaotic place dominated by 
wealth, political influence, and personal power. Many 
pray for the return of the Chosen and the completion of 
his work. Others are learning to live together without 
genie masters, and to grudgingly accept the remaining 
genasi among them. 

Chult. The vast, choking jungles of Chult hide what 
many believe to be great mineral wealth, including large 
gemstones and veins of ore. Poisonous flora and fauna 
riddle the jungles, but some still brave the dangers to 



CHAPTER 1 | WELCOME TO THE REALMS 





Northern 


seek their fortunes. Some of the exotic plants that grow 
only in Chult fetch high prices in mainland markets. Ru- 
ined Mezro stands across the sea from Calimshan, wait- 
ing for explorers and its displaced people to cleanse the 
city of its undead inhabitants and uncover the treasures 
that lie hidden there. 

Eastward along the Chultan peninsula lie the remains 
of Thindol and Samarach. Despite the apparent fall of 
both civilizations, Thindol remains infested with yu- 
an-ti, while the illusions cloaking Samarach’s mountain 
passes conceal the activities in that nation. 

Dambrath. Situated on a warm plain on the shore of 
the Great Sea, Dambrath is ruled by nomadic clans of 
human horse riders who revere Silvanus, Malar, and 
occasionally Selune. Given the Dambrathans’ history 
of domination by the Crinti, a ruling caste of half-drow, 
it is no surprise that they reserve their greatest hatred 
for the drow. 

The clans meet twice a year at a sacred site known as 
the Hills of the Kings, where dozens of totem sculptures 
are preserved. At these gatherings, each clan updates its 
totem with an account of its exploits over the previous 
seasons. Many Dambrathans seek out lycanthropy as a 
means of showing reverence for their favored deity and 
honoring their heritage. 


Elfharrow. A blasted near-desert north and east of the 
North Wall mountains bordering Halruaa, Elfharrow 
isn’t a name bestowed by its residents, but rather the 
sobriquet that travelers use for this violent region. The 
tribes of xenophobic elves that claim this area don’t hes- 
itate to discourage uninvited guests by any means nec- 
essary. A simple group of pilgrims might be scared off 
with some arrows, while a band of hunters or explorers 
is likely to be killed outright. 

Food is sparse in this region, with the forests long since 
vanished, and as a result the elves of Elfharrow fiercely 
protect the herds of animals they have cultivated. The 
elves have no interest in looting the cities of fallen Lapa- 
liiya, but neither are they willing to allow “adventurers” 
free access to those lands through their territory. 

Halruaa. Once believed destroyed in the conflagration 
of the Spellplague, Halruaa has largely been restored to 
the insular, magic-mighty nation it once was. Because 
of the foresight of their divinations, Halruaan wizards 
were able to use the raging blue fire that followed Mys- 
tra’s death to propel their nation safely into the realm of 
Toril’s twin, Abeir (displacing part of that world into the 
Plane of Shadow). 

Now that the events of those times have mostly been 
undone, the famed Halruaan skyships and waterborne

CHAPTER 1 | WELCOME TO THE REALMS 


vessels have spread out from their home once again, 
seeking to establish trading routes and political connec- 
tions, as well as to learn what has changed of the world 
in their century of absence. 

The Lake of Steam. Far to the south and east of the 
Sword Coast, the Lake of Steam is more accurately 
an inland sea, its waters tainted by volcanism and un- 
drinkable. Around its perimeter is a conglomeration of 
city-states and minor baronies typified by the shifting 
domains known as the Border Kingdoms. Here, along 
the southern shore of the lake, explorers and fortune 
seekers squander their amassed wealth building cas- 
tles, founding communities, and drawing loyal vassals 
to them— only to have all those good works disappear 
within a generation or two. In some cases, one of these 
realms is fortunate to be saved from its inevitable de- 
cline by another group of successful adventurers, who 
inject enough wealth and wisdom to keep the enterprise 
going a few more decades. 

Luiren. Long the homeland of halflings and thought 
to be the place where their race had its genesis, Luiren 
was lost during the Spellplague to a great inundation 
of the sea. In the century since that great disaster, the 
waters receded, and now stories told by travelers from 
the south tell of halfling communities that survived as 
island redoubts. 

Tethyr. Tethyr is a feudal realm ruled by Queen Anais 
from its capital of Darromar. The queen commands 
her dukes, who in turn receive homage from the counts 
and countesses of the realm, appoint sheriffs over their 
counties, and generally maintain order. The farmlands 
of Tethyr are abundant, and its markets flow freely with 
trade from the Western Heartlands. 

Tethyr has seen more than its share of noble intrigue 
and royal murder, and adventurers who are native to 
Tethyr or merely passing through that land are often 
drawn into such plots, either as unwitting accomplices 
or as easy scapegoats. 

Lands to the East 

To the east lie many of the older nations of the Realms, 
including the Western Heartlands of Faerun— those civ- 
ilizations centrally located on the continent, and thereby 
best able to take advantage of trade routes and access to 
the Sea of Fallen Stars. As in the North, there are cold 
lands to the east, as well as more temperate regions. As 
one travels farther from the Sword Coast, one moves 
from lands not so different from ones own to places so 
foreign they might as well exist on other continents or 
worlds— which a few of them actually have done. 

Aglarond. The great peninsula of Aglarond juts out 
into the Inner Sea, and that body of water and the for- 
ests of the Yuirwood define much of the nations charac- 
ter. A realm of humans living in harmony with their elf 
and half-elf neighbors, Aglarond has been a foe of Thay 
for centuries, in part due to the temperament of its for- 
mer ruler, the Simbul. The nation is now ruled by a Sim- 
barch Council, which has backed away from open hos- 
tilities with Thay. With the restoration of the Weave, the 
ongoing changes to the political landscape, and calls for 
elven independence within the nation, it is unclear what 


Regions of the Realms 

Just as “the North” describes an area that includes a num- 
ber of nations and governments, a number of collective 
terms exist for other regions across Faerun. Not all such 
names are used universally, and opinions vary as to which 
lands qualify in which groups. Here are some currently 
recognized regional groupings: 

The Cold Lands: Damara, Narfell, Sossal, and Vaasa 
The Heartlands: Cormyr, the Dalelands, the Moonsea, 
and Sembia 

The Lands of Intrigue: Amn, Calimshan, and Tethyr, also 
known as the Empires of the Sands 
The Old Empires: Chessenta, Mulhorand, and Unther 


sort of place Aglarond will be in a generation’s time, ex- 
cept that its potential for great change will be realized. 

Chessenta. A collection of city-states bound by com- 
mon culture and mutual defense, Chessenta isn’t truly 
a nation. Each city boasts its own heroes, worships its 
own gladiatorial champions, and spends as much time 
insulting and competing with the other cities as it does 
on any other activity. The city of Luthcheq is dominated 
by worship of the bizarre deity known as Entropy, while 
Erebos is ruled by the latest incarnation of the red 
dragon known as Tchazzar the Undying. Heptios con- 
tains the largest library in Chessenta, a center of learn- 
ing where all nobles aspire to send their children for tu- 
toring. That city is looked on with disdain by the people 
of Akanax, whose militant contempt for the “fat philos- 
ophers” of Heptios is widely known. Toreus welcomes 
all visitors, even those from lands that are despised or 
mistrusted, and foreign coin can buy nearly anything 
there. The floating city of Airspur still flies somehow, its 
earthmotes unaffected by the fall of its fellows when the 
Sundering came to a close. 

Cormyr. For most folk in central Faerun, the notion 
of a human kingdom is inextricably linked to Cormyr. 

A strong realm bolstered by its loyal army (the Purple 
Dragons), a cadre of magical defenders and investiga- 
tors (the War Wizards), and numerous wealthy and in- 
fluential nobles, Cormyr is recovering from its war with 
Sembia and Netheril— a conflict that cost the nation 
much, but left the kingdom standing, and which, in the 
end, Netheril didn’t survive. The pride of that victory re- 
mains strong in Cormyr’s collective consciousness, even 
as Queen Raedra draws back from plans to permanently 
welcome into the realm towns that lie beyond Cormyr’s 
traditional borders. 

Cormyreans are justly proud of their homeland, and go 
to great lengths to guard it and its honor. Still, there is no 
shortage of danger in the Forest Kingdom, whether from 
scheming, treacherous nobles, monsters out of the Hul- 
lack Forest or the Stonelands, or some ancient, hidden 
magic. Cormyr is many things, but dull isn’t one of them. 

The Cold Lands. The nations of Damara, Narfell, Sos- 
sal, and Vaasa, known collectively to most Faerunians as 
the Cold Lands, rest near the Great Glacier in the cold, 
dry environs of the northeast. Few outside the region 
have much interest in what goes on here, except for those 
in the immediately surrounding lands, who fear a resur- 
gence of the ancient evils of the region— though they ar- 


CHAPTER 1 | WELCOME TO THE REALMS 


en’t fearful enough to do more than send an adventuring 
party or two into the area to investigate. 

In Damara, the usurper King Yarin Frostmantle sits 
on the throne of the Dragonbane dynasty, while his peo- 
ple complain about his tyranny and the growing threat 
from demons across the country. In Narfell, skilled rid- 
ers and archers hunt, raid, and are gradually reclaiming 
their heritage as a great nation of mages who treated 
with devils. The Warlock Knights of Vaasa threaten to 
break the bounds of their nation and invade Damara, 
the Moonsea, or both, while some of its members sus- 
piciously eye the ominously silent Castle Perilous, per- 
haps planning another excursion to the place. The tiny 
nation of Sossal trades with its neighbors, but shares 
little of itself with the wider world. 

The Dalelands. The humans who call the Dalelands 
home want nothing more than lives untroubled by the 
concerns of larger nations. They take great pride in 
their peaceful coexistence with the elves of Cormanthor, 
and in their ability to remain largely self-sufficient and 
autonomous even when their homeland was used as a 
battlefield by Cormyr, Netheril, Sembia, and Myth Dran- 
nor in the recent conflicts. Featherdale and Tasseldale 
have reasserted their independence since the end of the 
war, and rejoined Archendale, Battledale, Daggerdale, 
Deepingdale, Harrowdale, Mistledale, Scardale, and 
Shadowdale on the Dales Council. The High Dale did 
the same shortly afterward. 

Dalesfolk are mistrustful of anyone unwilling to sac- 
rifice for the common good, but those who put in good 
work— whether in defense or labor— are accepted as 
equals, entitled to share in the rewards from their toil. 

The Hordelands. Formerly known as the Endless 
Wastes, this land has gained a new name among 
Faerunians, styled after the vast Tuigan horde that roared 
out of the east and rode against Faerun more than a 
century ago. After these tribesfolk were defeated, some 
of the fierce, mounted warriors who survived the conflict 
gathered to form the small nation of Yaimunnahar. Some 
others cling to the old ways, mastering the sword and the 
bow and riding across the steppes on their short-legged 
horses. Brave merchants still traverse the Golden Way 
to and from Kara-Tur, but those who return from such a 
voyage are fewer than they once were. 

Impiltur. With the rising of the waters of the Sea of 
Fallen Stars, some of Impilturs wealth and influence is 
returning, leading to whispers among the populace that 
a lost king of the line of old will rise up to lift Impiltur 
out of its woes and back to the great nation it once was. 

Impiltur is a nation of humans with pockets of 
dwarves and halflings among its populace. Where once 
a long royal line sat its throne and ruled over a unified 
kingdom, now a Grand Council sits around a table and 
struggles to combat the presence of demons, and demon 
worship, within the nations borders. 

The Moonsea. The shores of the Moonsea have long 
been home to cities that rise swiftly, relying on vigor- 
ous trade and gathering powerful mercenaries to their 
banners, only to overextend themselves and fall— some- 
times crumbling over time, and sometimes dropping 
like stones from the sky. 


Now that Netheril and Myth Drannor have fallen, 
those two great powers can no longer exert their in- 
fluence over the Moonsea, allowing the city of Hillsfar 
to spread its wings and eye southward expansion, and 
Mulmaster to once again further the worship of Bane. 
Phlan, Teshwave, Thentia, and Voonlar— all Moonsea 
cities where greater powers jockeyed for influence— now 
work to find their own identities before an unchecked or 
malevolent realm swallows them, one by one. 

This region is also home to the ruins of the Citadel of 
the Raven and Zhentil Keep, former strongholds of the 
Zhentarim, which the Black Network shows occasional 
interest in restoring. 

Mulhorand. Since the Chosen of the gods began to 
appear in the last few years, Mulhorand has become 
a land transformed. Its deities manifested fully in the 
forms of some of their descendants, and swiftly rallied 
the Mulan to overthrow the Imaskari. Aided by the 
mighty wizard Nezram, known as the World-Walker, 
the Mulhorandi overthrew the rulers of High Imaskar, 
who fled into the Plains of Purple Dust or to extraplanar 
safeholds. 

When the upheaval ended and the Chosen began to 
disappear, the gods of Mulhorand remained to rule 
their people, focusing their attention on defending their 
restored homeland to keep the war in Unther and Ty- 
manther from spilling over its borders. For the first time 
in centuries, the people in Mulhorand are free, with the 
gods declaring that slavery shall no longer be practiced 
among the Mulan since their return. 

Rashemen. A harsh, cold land filled with hardy folk, 
Rashemen is a fiercely traditional nation. It is ruled 
by its Iron Lord, Mangan Uruk, who speaks for the 
power behind the throne: the Wychlaran, the society 
of masked witches that determine Rashemen’s course. 
These witches wield great powers tied to the land and 
its magic and guard against evil fey and vengeful spirits. 
A small number of male spellcasters, known as the Old 
Ones, create magic items and weave arcane rituals for 
the witches. Rashemi witches revere the Three, a trium- 
virate of goddesses they call Bhalla (the Den Mother), 
Khelliara (the Forest Maiden), and the Hidden One. 

Over the centuries, scholars in other lands have specu- 
lated that these deities might be faces of Chauntea, Miel- 
ikki, and Mystra, respectively. 

The nations warriors are a fierce, stoic lot, famed for 
their strength, endurance, and stubbornness in battle. 
Rashemen is a long-standing enemy of Thay, and has 
often thwarted that nation’s ambitions to rule Faerun. 
Little pleases a Rashemi warrior more than the chance 
to strike down a Red Wizard in battle. 

Sembia. Following a period of subjugation at the 
hands of Netheril, Sembia is already on its way to 
becoming the economic power it was in prior years. 
Although relations are cool with the Dales and Cormyr 
following the most recent war, Sembian merchants are 
quick to dismiss previous conflicts as the work of the 
Netherese, and remind their former trading partners of 
the long and mutually profitable relationships they previ- 
ously enjoyed. To prove its good intentions, Sembia has 
“allowed” Featherdale and Tasseldale to regain their in- 
dependence, even though Sembian investors had owned 


CHAPTER 1 | WELCOME TO THE REALMS 


much of Featherdale for nearly seventy years when the 
war came to an end. 

Before Netheril claimed Sembia as a vassal state, mer- 
cenary work and adventuring were popular livelihoods 
among Sembians who didn’t have local families to feed. 
Those endeavors are even more popular now among 
veterans of the war, who are better trained than their 
predecessors were. A few of Sembia’s less scrupulous 
former soldiers have taken to banditry, which offers other 
Sembians more opportunities for guard work. 

Thay. For centuries one of the greatest concentrations 
of magical might in Faerun, Thay is ruled by the ancient 
lich, Szass Tam, and the nation’s Council of Zulkirs in 
a ruthless magocracy. The council’s will is enacted by 
regional tharchions and bureaucrats, leaving the ruling 
Red Wizards to focus on magical study and more im- 
portant arcane matters. 

For a time, living mages couldn’t hope to advance to 
prominence in Thay: Szass Tam promoted undeath as 
a means of existence with boundless possibilities, and 
held back those who didn’t agree with this philosophy. 
The recent battles with the demon Eltab, however, have 
prompted Szass Tam to loosen this stricture— the living 
now have hope of ascending within the Red Wizards, 
even if that hope is merely to advance to a high station 
within the cadre of Tam’s servants. 

Thesk. Reminders of the century-old war with the 
Tuigan horde remain throughout Thesk, in the many 
and varied features of its present-day inhabitants, partic- 
ularly the half-ore descendants of the mercenaries who 
fought in that great conflict. 

Thesk is known to many as the Gateway to the East 
because it is the western terminus of the Golden Way, 
which runs through the Hordelands and into Kara-Tur. 
Because their city is a crossroads of sorts between 
Faerun and the east, it should come as no surprise that 
Theskians don’t judge outsiders quickly, and don’t bris- 
tle at visitors who demonstrate strange quirks in speech 
or behavior. The people of Thesk trade readily with any 
folk, even nearby ores and goblins that are willing to 
treat with them peacefully. They aren’t fools, however, 
and have no patience for violent or raiding humanoids of 
all sorts. 

Turmish. On the southern shore of the Sea of Fallen 
Stars, Turmish is a nation of mercantile cities ruled 
by its Assembly of Stars, representatives of each of its 
cities in a parliamentary democracy. After being much 
diminished by the devastation wrought in this area a 
century ago, Turmish is currently enjoying a revival 
of its fortunes, as the rising of the waters of the Inner 
Sea has returned some of the trade that was lost in the 
cataclysm. Turmish is the birthplace of the Emerald En- 
clave, which has proudly taken credit for the rebirth of 
Turmishan agriculture, the cessation of the great rains 
that plagued the region a few years ago, and the resto- 1 
ration of the god Lathander. 

Tymanther. In decades past, the land of the drag- 
onborn claimed as its territory part of what had been 
the vanished nation of Unther. Then Unther suddenly 
returned to Faerun a few years ago and promptly went 
to war against Tymanther. The realm has since been 
reduced to small tracts mainly along the coast of the 


Coin of the Realms 

Nearly every major power of Faerun has its own currency: 
coins minted within its borders that represent both its in- 
fluence and material wealth. Most coins of pure composi- 
tion and standard weight are accepted at face value across 
the continent, though not every city-state or nation bothers 
to mint every sort of coin. 

Some of the most commonly found, and widely accept- 
ed, currency in the Realms is summarized below. Each 
grouping is arranged in order of value: copper, silver, 
electrum, gold, and (when present) platinum. Most people 
across Faerun refer to coins by whatever name the issuing 
government uses, regardless of origin, except for Zhentil 
Keep — for some reason, all Zhent coins have unflattering 
epithets associated with them. 

Amn: fander, taran, centaur, danter, roldon 

Cormyr: thumb, falcon, blue eye, golden lion, tricrown 

Sembia: steelpence (an iron coin), hawk, blue eye, noble 

Silverymoon: glint, shield, sword, dragon, unicorn 

Waterdeep: nib, shard, sambar, dragon, sun 

Zhentil Keep: fang (“dung-piece”), talon/naal (“flea-bit”), 

tarenth ("hardhammer”), glory (“weeping wolf”), 

platinum glory (“flat metal gem”) 

Silverymoon also mints two special coins: the moon and 
the eclipsed moon. The moon is a crescent-shaped, shin- 
ing blue coin of electrum, valued at 2 unicorns in Silvery- 
moon and nearby settlements, and 1 unicorn everywhere 
else. The eclipsed moon stamps an electrum moon with a 
darker silver wedge to complete a round coin. It is worth 5 
unicorns within the city, but only 2 unicorns elsewhere. 

Waterdeep has its own coins. The taol is a square piece 
of brass, worth 2 dragons in the city — and virtually worth- 
less to anyone not trading with Waterdeep. Most traders 
exchange their taols for standard coins before traveling. 
The “harbor moon” is a palm-sized crescent of platinum 
inset with electrum, and is worth 50 dragons in the city, 30 
dragons elsewhere. Its name comes from its common use 
in buying large amounts of cargo. Both taols and harbor 
moons are pierced to enable the bearer to string multiple 
coins together. 

Baldur’s Gate sets the standard for minting trade 
bars — ingots of metal (usually silver) of an accepted size 
and weight used in lieu of great piles of coins or gems for 
larger transactions. The most common such trade bar is a 
5-pound bar 6 inches long, 2 inches wide, and 1 inch thick, 
valued at 25 gp. 



CHAPTER 1 | WELCOME TO THE REALMS 


Alamber Sea and Ash Lake. The dragonborn that have 
withdrawn to those areas have lost none of their military 
tradition, and their ability to hold this smaller amount of 
territory makes it unlikely that Unther will push farther 
any time soon— particularly since the Untherite navy 
has been unable to overcome the great beast that guards 
the harbor of Djerad Kethendi and the nearby waters of 
the Alamber. 

Some of Tymanther’s dragonborn have spread across 
Faerun and gained reputations as competent, highly 
sought-after mercenaries. 

Unther. Trapped in another world, the people of 
Unther had succumbed to domination by others. Then 
among them arose one who called himself Gilgeam, and 
he reminded them of their former greatness. Under the 
leadership of this reincarnated god, the people of Unther 
rose up as an army to face their masters. On the eve of 
a great battle, the people of Unther were miraculously 
returned to their home, and Gilgeam wasted no time in 
leading them against the dragonborn occupying their 
ancestral lands. The Unthcritcs have retaken much of 
the land they formerly held, while seeking to wipe out 
the “godless lizards” they blame for their time of oppres- 
sion in Abeir. 

Gilgeam wants nothing short of a complete return to 
Unther’s former glory. This achievement will require ut- 
terly destroying Tymanther, of course, and eventual war 
with Mulhorand to reclaim lands lost centuries ago, but 
as every Untherite knows, the great God-King is patient, 
for he is eternal. 

Westgate. The dismal city of Westgate isn’t a romantic 
place, but someone seeking employment for shady work, 
or looking to hire someone for the same, will find few 
places better suited in all of Faerun. 

Westgate is considered by some Faerunians as a har- 
binger of the eventual fate of places like Amn and Sem- 
bia, where coin rules over all other considerations. As in 
many such places, one’s moral outlook is less important 
in Westgate than one’s attitude toward bribery. The 
city’s proximity to Cormyr makes it a breeding ground 
for that nation’s enemies, including the Fire Knives, a 
guild of thieves and assassins that the naive pretend 
doesn’t exist. 

Kara-Tur 

Far to the east, past the wastes of the Hordelands, lie 
the empires of Shou Lung, Kozakura, Wa, and the other 
lands of the vast continent of Kara-Tur. To most people 
of Faerun, Kara-Tur is like another world, and the tales 
told by travelers from its nations seem to confirm it. 

The gods that humans worship in Faerun are unknown 
there, as are common peoples such as gnomes and ores. 
Other dragons, neither chromatic nor metallic, dwell in 
its lands and fly its skies. And its mages practice forms 
of magic mysterious even to archwizards of Faerun. 

Stories of Kara-Tur tell of gold and jade in great 
abundance, rich spices, silks, and other goods rare 
or unknown in western lands— alongside tales of 
shapechanging spirit-people, horned giants, and night- 
mare monsters absent in Faerun. 


Zakhara 

Far to the south of Faerun, beyond Calimshan and even 
the jungles of Chult, are the Lands of Fate. Surrounded 
by waters thick with pirates and corsairs, Zakhara is 
a place less hospitable than most, but still braved by 
travelers who hope to profit from its exotic goods and 
strange magics. Like Kara-Tur, Zakhara seems a world 
away to Faerunians. It is thought of as a vast desert, 
sprinkled with glittering cities like scattered gems. Ro- 
mantic tales abound of scimitar-wielding rogues riding 
flying carpets and of genies bound in service to humans. 
Their mages, called sha’ir, practice their magic with the 
aid of genies and, it is said, might carry the lineage of 
these elemental beings in their blood. 

Beyond the Trackless Sea 

Farther to the west, past even Evermeet, are untold, un- 
known lands beyond the Trackless Sea. Many explorers 
have visited such lands, and some have even returned, 
bearing tales that change from generation to generation 
about exotic locales, from island chains that are the 
sites of countless shipwrecks, to fearsome feather-clad 
warriors, and vast continents that suddenly appeared 
where nothing— or something very much different— had 
rested only seasons prior. 

Time in the Realms 

Although a number of means exist for marking the days 
and the passage of time during a year, nearly all folk in 
Faerun have adopted the Calendar of Harptos. Even the 
cultures and races that don't favor this method of mark- 
ing time are aware of it, with the result that it is recog- 
nized across nearly all races, languages, and cultures. 

A year on Toril consists of 365 days. In the Calen- 
dar of Harptos, the year is divided into twelve months 
of thirty days, loosely following the synodic cycle of 
Selune, the moon. A month is made up of three ten- 
days, also known as rides. Five annual holidays, falling 
between the months, complete the 365-day calendar. 
Once every four years, the Calendar of Harptos includes 
Shieldmeet as a “leap day” following Midsummer. 

Individual days of a tenday have no special names. In- 
stead, they are denoted by counting from the beginning 
of the period (“first day,” “second day,” and so on). Days 
of the month are designated by a number and the month 
name. For example, sages would record an event as oc- 
curring on “1 Mirtul” or “27 Uktar.” People might also 
refer to a given day by its relationship to the current date 
(“two tendays from today”) or the nearest holiday (“three 
days past Greengrass”). 

Special Calendar Days 

Every nation, faith, and culture across Faerun has its 
own special festivals and holidays, the observances of 
which are governed by the cycles of the sun, the moon, 
the stars, or some other event. In addition, the Calendar 
of Harptos specifies five annual festivals keyed to the 
changing of the seasons and one quadrennial festival 
that are observed in almost every land, with particular 


CHAPTER 1 | WELCOME TO THE REALMS 


celebrations varying based on local traditions and popu- 
lar faiths. 

Midwinter. The first festival day of the year is known 
generally as Midwinter, though some people name it 
differently. Nobles and monarchs of the Heartlands look 
to the High Festival of Winter as a day to commemo- 
rate or renew alliances. Commoners in the North, the 
Moonsea, and other, colder climes celebrate Deadwinter 
Day as a marking of the midpoint of the cold season, 
with hard times still ahead, but some of the worst 
days now past. 

Greengrass. The traditional beginning of spring, 
Greengrass is celebrated by the display of freshly cut 
flowers (grown in special hothouses wherever the cli- 
mate doesn't permit flowers so early) that are given as 
gifts to the gods or spread among the fields in hopes of a 
bountiful and speedy growing season. 

Midsummer. The midpoint of summer is a day of 
feasting, carousing, betrothals, and basking in the 
pleasant weather. Storms on Midsummer night are seen 
as bad omens and signs of ill fortune, and sometimes 
interpreted as divine disapproval of the romances or 
marriages sparked by the day’s events. 

Shieldmeet. The great holiday of the Calendar of 
Harptos, Shieldmeet occurs once every four years 
immediately after Midsummer. It is a day for plain 
speaking and open council between rulers and their 
subjects, for the renewal of pacts and contracts, and for 
treaty making between peoples. Many tournaments and 
contests of skill are held on Shieldmeet, and most faiths 
mark the holiday by emphasizing one of their key tenets. 

The next Shieldmeet will be observed in 1492 DR. 

Highharvestide. A day of feasting and thanks, High- 
harvestide marks the fall harvest. Most humans give 
thanks to Chauntea on this day for a plentiful bounty be- 
fore winter approaches. Many who make their living by 
traveling road or sea set out immediately following the 
holiday, before winter comes on in full force and blocks 
mountain passes and harbors. 

The Feast of the Moon. As nights lengthen and 
winter winds begin to approach, the Feast of the Moon 
is the time when people celebrate their ancestors and 
their honored dead. During festivals on this day, people 
gather to share stories and legends, offer prayers for the 
fallen, and prepare for the coming cold. 

Keeping Time from Day to Day 

Most people don’t keep track of the time of day beyond 
notions such as “mid-morning” or “nigh sunset.” If peo- 
ple plan to meet at a particular time, they tend to base 
their arrangements around such expressions. 

The concept of hours and minutes exists mainly 
where wealthy people use clocks, but mechanical clocks 
are often unreliable, and rarely are two set to the same 
time. If a local temple or civic structure has a clock that 
tolls out the passing of the hours, people refer to hours 
as “bells,” as in “I’ll meet you at seven bells.” 

The Shifting of the Seasons 

The worlds of Abeir and Toril drifted apart in 1487 and 
1488 DR. In some places this change was accompanied

by cataclysm, while in others the shift went without no- 
tice. Astronomers and navigators who closely watched 
the stars couldn’t fail to see that there were nights 
when they seemed to hang in the sky. The winter of 
1487-1488 lasted longer than normal. It was then noted 
that the solstices and equinoxes had somehow shifted, 
beginning with the spring equinox falling on Green- 
grass of 1488 DR. The seasons followed suit, with each 
starting later and ending later. 

This shift in seasons has caused some sages, and the 
priests of Chauntea, to consider changing the marking 
of some of the annual feast days, but most folk counsel 
patience, believing that the seasons will fall back to their 
previous cycle over the coming years. 

A Brief History 

The known history of the Sword Coast region spans 
thousands of years, extending back into the misty ep- 
ochs of the creator races and the ages of the first nations 
of the elves and dwarves. Comparatively recent history 
is the story of the rise and deeds of humans and other 
younger races. 

Much of what follows in this section is known mainly 
by sages, some of whom have been alive for the last few 
centuries of Faerun’s history. The common folk across 
the continent have little knowledge of, and little use for, 
events that have transpired far away in time and space. 
News does travel, of course, so even people who live in a 
village along the Sword Coast might get wind of happen- 
ings in distant lands. 

The Days of Thunder 

Tens of thousands of years ago, empires of reptilian, 
amphibian, and avian peoples— known in Elvish as 
Iqua'Tel'Quessir ; the creator races— dominated the 
world. They built great cities of stone and glass, carved 
paths through the wilderness, tamed the great lizards, 
worked mighty magics, shaped the world around them,

and warred upon each other. Those were the Days 
of Thunder. 

The age of the creator races came to a sudden end 
some thirty thousand years ago. Perhaps their wars 
reached a terrible and inevitable crescendo, or they tam- 
pered with forbidden forces. For whatever reason, the 
world changed, and their vast empires vanished. All that 
remains of them are ruins and the scattered lizardfolk, 
bullywug, and aarakocra tribes, barbaric descendants of 
those who once ruled the world. 

The First Flowering 

From the ruins of the Days of Thunder arose the first 
nations of the Proud People— the elves and dwarves— in 
the region. 

The elves raised up the nations of Aryvandaar, 

Ardeep, and Ilythiir. They settled Illefarn along the 
Sword Coast, from the Spine of the World to the River 
Delimbiyr— its capitol Aelinthaldaar in the shadow of 
what is now Mount Waterdeep. Wood elves and moon 
elves founded the kingdom of Eaerlann in the Delimbiyr 
Valley and the High Forest, and separatists from Ary- 
vandaar settled Miyeritar in the lands of the present-day 
High Moor and Misty Forest. 

The dwarf clans united as the nation of Delzoun, 
named for its forge-founder, with dwarfholds built on 
sites ranging from the Ice Mountains to the Nether 
Mountains and the Narrow Sea, and settlements and 
halls westward to the Crags and the Sword Mountains. 

The Proud People regularly defended their homelands 
against ore hordes that arose from the mountains of 
the Spine of the World and surged southward to attack 
and pillage. 

The First Sundering 

Thousands of years after the rise of the great elven 
nations, hundreds of elf high mages united to cast a 
spell intended to create a glorious homeland for their 
race. The spell succeeded, but it rippled backward and 
forward in time, and the land was sundered, changing 
the face of the world. The largest continent of this new 
world is now called Faerun. Far from its western shores 
rose the isle of Evermeet, considered a part of Arvandor, 
the home of the elven gods on the plane of Arborea, and 
a bridge between worlds. 

The Crown Wars 

Some thirteen thousand years ago, war broke out be- 
tween the elven nations of Aryvandaar and Miyeritar, 
beginning a series of conflicts known as the Crown 
Wars. Lasting some three thousand years, these con- 
flicts culminated in the Dark Disaster, in which terrible 
storms engulfed Miyeritar, turning it into a wasteland 
within a single season, leaving behind the area now 
known as the High Moor. The high mages of Aryvan- 
daar are blamed for the destruction, although no proof 
was ever produced. 

The vengeful dark elves of Ilythiir turned to corrupt 
and demonic powers, unleashing them against Aryvan- 
daar. In the centuries of destruction that followed, elf 
priests and high mages fervently prayed to Corellon Lar- 
ethian and the gods of the elven pantheon for salvation. 


The Descent of the Drow 

Corellon interceded in the Crown Wars and cursed the 
dark elves so that they might never dwell comfortably 
under the sun. Now finding themselves pained by ex- 
posure to daylight, the drow— in a mere two months’ 
time— retreated from the sunlit lands of the World Above 
into the Underdark. They abandoned all loyalty to the 
elven gods who betrayed and banished them, turning 
instead to Lolth, the Demon Queen of Spiders, as their 
patron. Wars soon began between the drow and the un- 
derground cities of the dwarves. 

The Age of Humanity 

For millennia following the end of the Crown Wars, hu- 
mans spread and settled throughout Faerun as the elven 
and dwarven nations stagnated and then began a long, 
slow decline. Deep in the Underdark, the drow fought 
wars of survival and conquest in their new domain. 

The Rise and Fall of Netheril 

More than five thousand years ago, a group of human 
fishing villages on the shores of the Narrow Sea joined 
under the rule of the shaman-king Nether, becoming 
known as the empire of Netheril. The Netherese learned 
the use of magic from the Eaerlanni elves and became 
renowned wizards. Centuries later, they discovered the 
arcane texts known as the Nether Scrolls in the ruins of 
Aryvandaar and subsequently abandoned the practices 
of the Eaerlanni in order to procure even greater mag- 
ical power. 

Netheril grew to become an invincible nation of magic 
and wonders, dominating much of the North for three 
thousand years. Then the power-mad Netherese arcan- 
ist Karsus attempted to usurp the role of the goddess of 
magic. The resulting disruption in the fabric of magic 
sent Netheril’s floating cities crashing to the ground, 
destroyed a host of other wards and enchantments, and 
brought about the end of the great empire. 

The Great Cities 

In the decades and centuries following the collapse of 
Netheril, many cities of the Sword Coast and the North, 
such as Illusk and Citadel Sundbarr, took in refugees 
from the fallen empire, and new settlements made up 
entirely or primarily of human survivors from Netheril 
and their descendants were established throughout the 
North and in the Western Heartlands. 

Nearly fifteen hundred years ago, the human settlers 
of the Dalelands and the elves of Cormanthor pledged 
their alliance in an agreement known as the Dales 
Compact. A monument called the Standing Stone 
was erected to mark the occasion, and the advent of 
Dalereckoning was decreed, beginning with the year 1 
DR. This method of numbering the years in Toril’s his- 
tory has spread across Faerun and is commonly under- 
stood (if not universally accepted). 

The city of Neverwinter— called Eigersstor when it 
was a mere settlement— was founded in 87 DR. On the 
banks of the River Raurin, the humble community of 
Silverymoon Ford came into being in 384 DR, and less 
than two centuries later it had grown to become the city 
of Silverymoon. 


CHAPTER 1 | WELCOME TO THE REALMS 


In 882 DR, a village and trading post on the shore of a 
deep bay in the shadow of a great mountain was named 
Nimoar’s Hold, after the Uthgardt chieftain who claimed 
the area and fortified it. The place became known to sea 
captains as “Waterdeep," a name that displaced the orig- 
inal within a few generations. In 1032 DR, Ahghairon, 
heir to the arts of Netheril, saved the city from itself by 
unseating Waterdeep’s warlord and would-be emperor, 
Raurlor. Ahghairon declared that wisdom, not strength 
of arms, would rule in the city from now on, and created 
the Lords of Waterdeep. 

These and other nations and great city-states rose to 
prominence along the Sword Coast, forming a chain 
along the Trade Way from Illusk in the far north to 
Baldur’s Gate in the south, near the borders of Amn. 

Like their elven and dwarven predecessors, they fought 
off attacks by savage humanoids, including ore hordes 
from the Spine of the World. Waterdeep, guided by its 
mysterious Lords, became a rising power, while old 
Illusk fell to the ores for decades, until it was eventually 
reclaimed and the city of Luskan built upon its ruins. 

The Present Age 

The four and a half centuries since the establishment of 
the Lords of Waterdeep have been tumultuous times for 
the Sword Coast and the world. Throughout this period, 
civilization struggles against the savage forces of chaos, 
and life attempts to persevere against the agents of death 
and strife, sometimes in places where even the gods 
themselves have not been exempt from destruction. 

The last one hundred fifty years have comprised one 
of the most cataclysmic periods in Faerun’s history. On 
no fewer than three occasions, Toril has been shaken to 
its core by forces that have repeatedly rewritten the laws 
of reality. 

The Time of Troubles 

In 1358 DR, the gods were cast out of their otherworldly 
domain and made to wander the land incarnated as 
mortals. In seeking to recover their divinity, they warred 
among themselves. Magic became unpredictable, and 
the prayers of the faithful went unanswered. Some of 
the gods-turned-mortal were slain, while a handful of 
mortals ascended to godhood, assuming the responsibil- 
ities of the dead deities. 

The Return of Netheril 

In 1374 DR, the Empire of Netheril rose again when the 
floating city of Thultanthar, commonly known as Shade, 
returned from a nearly two-thousand-year-long excur- 
sion in the Shadowfell, to hover above the Anauroch 
desert. The shadow-touched nobles of the city almost 
immediately began hunting for ancient Netherese ruins 
and artifacts and preparing for a restoration of their 
once-great empire. 

The Spellplague 

In 1385 DR, the ascended deity Cyric, aided by Shar, 
murdered Mystra, the goddess of magic, in her domain 
of Dweomerheart. This act ripped asunder the fabric 
of magic in the world, unleashing its raw power in a 
catastrophe called the Spellplague. Thousands of prac- 


titioners of the Art were driven mad or killed, while the 
face of Faerun was reshaped by waves and veils of mys- 
tic blue fire. Entire nations were displaced or exchanged 
with realms from other worlds, and parts of the earth 
were torn free to float in the air. 

The Second Sundering 

A century after the Spellplague, the lands and peoples of 
Faerun had become accustomed to the state of things— 
just in time for everything to change again. 

The first indication of new turmoil came in 1482 DR, 
when Bhaal, the long-dead god of murder, was reborn 
in Baldur’s Gate amid chaos and bloodshed, leaving two 
of the city’s dukes and many of its citizens dead. The 
return of Bhaal and his apparent reclamation of the do- 
main of murder from Cyric led some scholars and sages 
to believe that the rules by which all deities must abide 
were in flux. 

In 1484, strange calamities began to occur through- 
out Faerun. An earthquake struck Iriaebor. A plague 
of locusts afflicted Amn. Droughts gripped the south- 
ern lands as the sea steadily receded in places. Amid 
this tumult, conflict broke out in many regions of the 
continent. The ores of Many-Arrows warred against 
the dwarfholds of the North and their allies. Sembia 
invaded the Dalelands, and Cormyr raised an army to 
come to the aid of the Dalesfolk. Netheril brought forces 
to Cormyr’s border, and Cormyr was drawn into a war 
on both fronts. 

Throughout this period, tales began to spread of indi- 
viduals who had been touched by the gods and granted 
strange powers. Some of these so-called Chosen were 
at the root of the conflicts that grip the land. Some 
seemed driven by divine purpose, while others claimed 
to be mystified as to why they would be singled out. 

In 1485. in Icewind Dale, the Chosen of Auril foments 
war with Ten-Towns and was defeated. In Anauroch, 
seeing that Netherese forces were spread thin, the 
long-subjugated Bedine people rebelled. Having de- 
feated or besieged the dwarfholds of the North, ores 
march on Silverymoon. In Cormyr and Sembia, the 
Netherese and the Cormyreans traded ground, while the 
Dalelands became a war zone. As if to offset the drought 
in the south, in the autumn of 1485 the Great Rain be- 
gan to fall around the Sea of Fallen Stars and continued 
unceasingly. 

While the waters rose to the east in early 1486, the 
tide turned against the ores in the North, and by the 
end of the year their armies were broken and scattered. 
Also during that year, the elves of Myth Drannor came 
to the aid of the Dalelands and helped push back Sem- 
bian forces. On the Sword Coast, the Hosttower of the 
Arcane rose again in Luskan, along with the Arcane 
Brotherhood. In Waterdeep and Neverwinter, efforts 
were made to clear those cities of century-old rubble 
and neglect. Cormyr repulsed the last of the Sembian 
and Netherese forces from the nation, reclaiming its ter- 
ritory, and recalled its forces, turning inward to address 
issues of rebuilding. 

Late in 1486, the Great Rain finally abated, but this 
event didn’t signify an end to the chaos. The Sea of 


CHAPTER 1 | WELCOME TO THE REALMS 


Fallen Stars had grown, submerging great swaths of 
land beneath its waves. 

Early in 1487, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions 
abounded for months, as if the whole world was con- 
vulsing. Rumors spread of chasms caused by the 
Spellplague suddenly vanishing, and stories circulated 
of known destinations being farther away from one 
another, as if the world had quietly added miles of wil- 
derness to the distance between them. Word began to 
spread of places and peoples not heard from since the 
Spellplague. It became apparent that some of the effects 
of that terrible time had been reversed. During the year, 
ships claiming to be from Evermeet, Lantan, and Nim- 
bral— nations thought vanished or destroyed— sailed 
into ports on the Sword Coast and in the Shining South. 
Tales spread of the legendary skyships of Halruaa being 
spotted in southern skies. No longer engaged in Cormyr, 
Netheril attacked Myth Drannor by floating the City of 
Shade over it. In a struggle for control of Myth Dran- 
nor’s mythal and the Weave itself, the flying capital of 
Netheril was brought crashing down on Myth Drannor, 
resulting in the cataclysmic destruction of both. 

As the year drew to a close, there were nights when 
the heavens seemed to hang motionless. Throughout 
much of Faerun, the winter of 1487 and 1488 lasted lon- 
ger than any on record. The solstices and equinoxes had 
somehow drifted. Later seasons followed suit, with each 
starting and ending later than expected. Prayers to the 
gods for knowledge and mercy seemed to go unacknowl- 
edged, apart from the presence of their Chosen. 

Although the ores were defeated in the North, the 
League of Silver Marches was disbanded in 1488, as 
former allies blamed one another for failures in the war. 
Sembia divided into separate city-states only nominally 
allied with one another. While a handful of settlements 
survived, the Netherese Empire was no more. The re- 
mainder of the Netherese forces battle with the Bedine 
over control of the Memory Spire, thought to be a tomb 
of the phaerimm, Netheril’s ancient enemies. The battle 
awakens what turns out to be a hive of the creatures, 
and they use the life and magic-draining power of the 
spire against the lands below. 

By 1489, many of the wars that began during the Sun- 
dering had ground to a close. Other conflicts arose, and 
mighty threats still imperiled the world, but the deities 
ceased interfering with the world through their Chosen. 
The gods were no longer silent but quiet, and in many 
places new priesthoods arose to interpret the gods’ now 
subtle signs. 

The world today seems a place filled with new lands 
and opportunities, where those who dare can leave their 
mark. Students of history and those elves and dwarves 
who recall the past that short-lived humans see as dis- 
tant perceive a world much like it was over a century 
ago. For most folk, wild tales of people empowered by 
the gods, and of far-off lands returned to the world, are 
the subjects of fireside chatter. Daily concerns and the 
dangers and opportunities just beyond their doors take 
precedence, and plenty of both remain on the Sword 
Coast and in the North. 


Magic in the Realms 

From the simplest cantrip to the mightiest workings of 
High Magic, from the blessings of healing mercy to the 
raising of mighty heroes from the dead, magic perme- 
ates the Realms. Any understanding of magic begins, 
and ends, with an understanding of the Weave. 

The Weave 

The Weave is an essential element of the universe, 
running through everything in unseen threads. Some 
creatures, objects, and locations have deep, intrinsic 
ties to the Weave and can perform extraordinary feats 
that come naturally to them (a beholder’s flight, a vam- 
pire’s charming gaze, a dragon’s breath weapon, and so 
forth). Creatures with the necessary talent and skill can 
also manipulate the Weave to perform magic by cast- 
ing spells. 

The Weave isn’t normally visible or detectable, even 
through the use of spells. Detect magic doesn’t let you 
perceive the Weave, for instance. The Weave isn’t magic, 
precisely, any more than a collection of threads is a gar- 
ment; it’s the raw material from which the tapestry of 
magic is woven. 

In two senses, both the metaphorical and the real, 
the goddess Mystra is the Weave. She is its keeper 
and tender, but all three times the goddess of magic 
has died or been separated from her divinity (twice as 
Mystra, and once as her predecessor, Mystryl), magic 
has been twisted or has failed entirely. With Mystra’s 
last death and the coming of the Spellplague, the 
Weave was thought destroyed, and the term lost its 
significance. Since the end of the most recent Sunder- 
ing, both Mystra and the Weave have returned to their 
roles of centuries past, and spells and magic items 
are more reliable than they had been while the Spell- 
plague raged. 

Supernatural Powers 
and Psionics 

The inborn magical abilities of certain creatures, the 
acquired supernatural powers of people such as monks, 
and psionic abilities are similar in that their users don’t 
manipulate the Weave in the customary way that spell- 
casters do. The mental state of the user is vitally import- 
ant: monks and some psionics-users train long and hard 
to attain the right frame of mind, while creatures with 
supernatural powers have that mind-set in their nature. 
How these abilities are related to the Weave remains a 
matter of debate; many students of the arcane believe 
that the use of the so-called Unseen Art is an aspect of 
magical talent that can’t be directly studied or taught. 

Magic Items 

Where a spell effect is brought to life by manipulating 
the threads of the Weave, the creation of a magic item 
ties some of those threads together in a specific way, to 
produce the desired effect for as long as the item lasts. 
The Weave provides immediately available energy for 
spells and also enables those who know the craft to har- 




C H \?TER 1 | WELCOME TO THE REALMS 




M 




ness that energy inside an object until it is called forth 
by its user (who, of course, need not be a spellcaster). 

In some cases, the magic of an item must be tied to 
its wielder, representing an entwining of the threads 
of the Weave between wielder and object known as 
attunement. As with all matters related to magic, the 
number of items to which a single being can be attuned 
is limited, but the benefits of such a relationship can be 
considerable. 

Mythals • 

Mythals are some of the most powerful magic in the 
world of Toril, constructs that bind and shape the 
Weave in a particular location, sometimes so powerfully 
that the rules of magic or even reality can be bent or 
rewritten. 

A mythal is a permanent field of overlapping magical 
wards and effects tied to a specific location. In its origi- 
nal usage, this term applied to the works of High Magic 
that protected ancient elven cities. It has since been 
expanded to cover all manner of similar protections, 
from the immense floating cities of fallen Netheril to 
the wards of Silverymoon to the smaller— but no less 
effective— workings of magic that keep safe important 
locations like Candlekeep. Even the many-layered wards 
and effects of Undermountain, beneath Waterdeep, are 
considered a mythal by some. 

Most mythals are defensive in nature, designed to 
restrict the kinds of magic that can be employed in the 
area they govern, and the most common restrictions are 
concerned with teleportation and conjuration magic. Ev- 
ereska’s mythal influences the weather of the area and 
wards its inhabitants against disease, while the mythal 
of undersea Myth Nantar makes its waters breathable 
and more comfortable for creatures not suited to under- 
water life. 

In many ways, a mythal is less like a spell or a magic 
item than a living creation of magic, capable of grow- 
ing stronger or weaker, absorbing damage, or dying. 
Mythals can also sometimes heal themselves, as did 
the mythal of Silverymoon, blossoming out of the 
Moonbridge following Mystra’s most recent return. 
Each active mythal has one or more beings attuned 
to its effects, who can ignore any restrictions on spell- 
casting, can direct targetable effects of the mythal , and 
can teach others of appropriate skill how to access 
its secrets. 

Except in cities such as Silverymoon and Evereska, 
adventurers are most likely to encounter damaged or 
failing mythals in ruined locations where magic once 
had great influence. Although an identify spell might 
reveal some of the simplest effects of a mythal, active 
restrictions on spellcasting can be discovered only by 
trying (and failing) to cast a prohibited spell. A powerful 
spellcaster might learn how to access or repair a mythal 
without assistance, but such feats are legendary, and 
rarely attempted by even the most renowned of mages. 
Any elven city with Myth in its title (Myth Drannor, 

Myth Glaurach, Myth Nantar, and others) has, or had, a 
mythal protecting it. The ruins of such places are cer- 
tain to have unpredictable effects related to their dam- 
aged or destroyed mythals. 


Weave-Affecting Magic 

Certain spells allow casters to perceive or manipulate the 
effects of the Weave in particular ways. The Weave itself 
also has irregularities that affect spells. 

Detect Magic. Detect magic reveals threads of the Weave 
woven together through spellcasting, or the “knots” of the 
Weave in a magic item. A magic item appears enmeshed 
in the silvery-blue threads of the Weave, and the way the 
threads are arranged reveals what type of magic is used 
(necromancy, abjuration, and so on). Similarly, active 
spells and areas imbued with magic are limned in a silvery 
network of threads, which might twist and reknit them- 
selves depending on the magic involved. 

Dispel Magic. Dispel magic unwinds and prematurely 
ends magic, unraveling whatever construct of the Weave 
was put in place. 

Antimagic. Antimagic effects can dispel existing spells 
and unravel any magic woven from the Weave. Perma- 
nent effects, such as those from magic items, are usually 
suppressed by antimagic: while the effect is within an 
area of antimagic, the construct of the Weave unravels, 
but the threads snap back into place once the magic is 
outside the area. 

Dead Magic. In rare areas of dead magic, the Weave 
is absent. Not only do spells and magic items cease to 
function, but even the supernatural abilities of creatures 
that are innately tied to the Weave might fail as the knot of 
the Weave they carry with them unravels. 

Wild Magic. In an area of wild magic, the Weave 
becomes “tangled,” spontaneously forming its own 
constructs and resulting magic. It also tends to twist the 
constructs of the Weave created by spellcasting, causing 
unexpected results. 


Religion in the Realms 

Though wizards work wonders with their Art, and 
adventurers take their fates into their own hands, it is 
on the gods that most folk in the Forgotten Realms de- 
pend when they have need. The gods play a role in the 
lives of nearly everyone, from the mightiest lord to the 
meanest urchin. 

The various races of Toril worship their pantheons, 
which remain largely the same from region to region, 
with different cultures and societies emphasizing some 
deities over others. Although exceptions exist— the gods 
of Mulhorand, for example— all the gods are revered 
across all of Faerun. 

Forms of Worship 

The average person worships different gods in different 
contexts. Most vocations have a patron deity: farmers 
make offerings to Chauntea for the prosperity of their 
crops, clerks sharpen their quills with a prayer to De- 
neir, while pious merchants remember to set coins aside 
for Waukeen at the end of the day. Most people worship 
a deity associated with their livelihood, family, or home, 
while others feel called to a particular god for a variety 
of reasons. Individuals often carry or wear a small token 
of their favored deity: a pendant or a pin in the image of 
the gods holy symbol, or some other personal keepsake. 

In addition, people regularly venerate gods based on 
their needs and circumstances: a farmer whose favored 
deity is Chauntea would pray to Amaunator for a few 
clear, sunny days, and a Waterdhavian noble who habit- 


CHAPTER 1 | WELCOME TO THE REALMS 


ually worships Denier would give thanks to Sune after a 
successful coming-out party for her son. Even priests of 
particular gods acknowledge the roles that other deities 
play in the world and in their lives. 

In general, worshipers view their relationships with 
the gods as practical and reciprocal: they pray and make 
offerings because that is how one invites the blessings 
of the gods and turns away their wrath. These prayers 
and other acts of devotion are generally performed qui- 
etly at the shrine in one’s household or community, or 
occasionally in a temple dedicated to one’s deity, when 
a worshiper feels the need to “come knocking upon a 
god’s door” to ask for attention. 

Forms of worship are often acts of veneration: giving 
thanks for favor shown, making requests for future 
blessings, and offering praise for the deity’s interces- 
sions, large and small. Because most folk in Faerun 
don’t want to attract the ire of the cruel or savage gods, 
beseeching them to keep the peace is also an act of 
worship. A hunter or a farmer might make offerings to 
Malar in hopes of keeping predators at bay, and a sailor 
might pray to Umberlee that she withhold her wrath for 
the duration of a voyage. 

New and Foreign Gods 

The Faerunian pantheon isn’t the only one known on 
Toril. Nonhuman races honor their own gods, for exam- 
ple, and people in faraway lands are known to worship 
altogether different gods. Occasionally, foreigners bring 
the worship of these gods to Faerun. In addition, on 
rare occasions a new god comes into being, perhaps a 
mortal elevated to godhood or a deity whose arrival was 
foretold by prophets and leaders of new religions. In 
cosmopolitan places such as Waterdeep and Calimshan, 
small shrines and temples to strange gods spring up 
from time to time. 

The burgeoning worship of a new deity is rarely a con- 
cern to the other gods of the Faerunian pantheon, and 
the people who revere those deities, except when the 
newcomer’s area of concern directly competes with that 
of an established deity. The methods of resolving such 
conflicts range from friendly dueling festivals or rites 
meant to emphasize the glory of one god over another, to 
campaigns of outright religious bloodshed. 

Over generations, a new god might become a set- 
tled-in member of the pantheon. Indeed, some scholars 
posit that Faerun has many “immigrant” gods, who 
joined the pantheon’s ranks so long ago that their for- 
eign origins are lost in antiquity. 

Dead and Resurrected Gods 

Over and over, mourning bells have tolled for some 
of the deities of the Realms. Gods were struck down 
during the Time of Troubles, when the Spellplague 
wrought its destruction, and most recently when Neth- 
eril fell. Some deities have even been slain by mortals 
wielding impossibly powerful magic. 

When a god withdraws from a pantheon, divine magic 
stops flowing to the faithful, and miracles and omens 
associated with that god cease, that deity’s priesthood 
loses faith, and holy sites are abandoned or taken over 
by other faiths. To the deity’s worshipers in the world, 


it is immaterial whether the god is truly dead or merely 
dormant— the consequences for them are the same 
either way. Yet, as recent events have borne out, a god 
who is gone might not remain absent forever. More than 
a few supposedly dead gods have returned and amassed 
a new body of worshipers. Indeed, the legends of some 
gods speak of a cycle of death and resurrection. 

As the Sage of Shadowdale once noted, “If the gods 
can grant the power to raise mortals from death, why do 
ye assume they should be laid low by it forever?” 

The Afterlife 

Most humans believe the souls of the recently deceased 
are spirited away to the Fugue Plane, where they wan- 
der the great City of Judgment, often unaware they are 
dead. The servants of the gods come to collect such 
souls and, if they are worthy, they are taken to their 
awaited afterlife in the deity’s domain. Occasionally, the 
faithful are sent back to be reborn into the world to fin- 
ish work that was left undone. 

Souls that are unclaimed by the servants of the gods 
are judged by Kelemvor, who decides the fate of each 
one. Some are charged with serving as guides for other 
lost souls, while others are transformed into squirming 
larvae and cast into the dust. The truly false and faith- 
less are mortared into the Wall of the Faithless, the 
great barrier that bounds the City of the Dead, where 
their souls slowly dissolve and begin to become part of 
the stuff of the Wall itself. 

Religious Institutions 

Those who serve as priests of a god aren’t necessarily 
clerics. Indeed, the power invested in clerics and other 
divine spellcasters by the gods is given out only rarely 
(see “Divine Magic” below). The work of a priest is to 
serve one’s deity and that deity’s faithful, a task that 
doesn’t necessarily require the use of magic. 

The kind of person attracted to a deity’s priesthood 
depends on the tenets of that god: the cunning rogues 
who venerate Mask have little in common with the up- 
right law-keepers of Tyr, and the delightful revelers who 
revere Lliira are different from both. 

Temples and Shrines 

The core religious institutions of Faerun are temples 
and shrines. Whether a small, out-of-the-way building, 
or a complex made up of multiple structures and tracts 
of land, each temple operates according to the traditions 
of its faith, although powerful or charismatic figures 
who rise to prominence within the temple hierarchy 
might motivate or inspire changes to those traditions. 

Temples in Faerun don’t have regular services as 
such. Group observances in a temple occur only at spe- 
cific festival times, and priests also go out into the com- 
munity to perform rites such as marriages and funerals. 
Temples are places where worshipers go either to spend 
personal or family time in a space consecrated to a deity 
or to seek the aid of the priests for some reason. 

Small shrines and private chapels, as distinct from 
full-fledged temples, are common throughout Faerun, 
particularly in areas where a temple doesn’t exist.

Shrines tend to be unstaffed, kept up by the locals and 
visitors who use the place for prayer. A shrine might be 
as modest as a roadside well, where traveling merchants 
can drop a coin to request good fortune from Waukeen, 
or as grand as a statue of Amaunator surrounded by bra- 
ziers in a pavilion in the middle of a village. 

Traveling priests often seek out and visit these sites, 
and they act as meeting places for the faithful. When 
word gets around that a traveling priest of Eldath has 
come into town, the faithful seek her out at the holy 
spring dedicated to the goddess at the edge of town. 

A family or business might maintain a shrine or a 
chapel to its favored deity, perhaps a set of wind chimes 
consecrated to Akadi hung from the high branches of 
a tree in the garden, or a wooden symbol shaped like 
the hand of Azuth in miniature displayed on a prom- 
inent wall with a space nearby to burn a candle or 
some incense. 

Communing with the Gods 

Though many tales are told of times past when the gods 
appeared in physical form and walked the land, occa- 
sions of that sort are few and far between. For the most 
part, the gods communicate with their faithful through 
signs and omens, appreciated by those able to interpret 
them. Of course, some signs are more subtle— and thus 
more open to interpretation— than others. 

The most common kind of communion that worship- 
ers and priests find with their deities is in prayer, song, 
or meditation. Such experiences are intensely personal, 
and it is common wisdom to keep them that way. After 
all, “advice” from one’s god that appears during morning 
prayer and gives one a good turn to the day is worth- 
while only for oneself. Let each worshiper commune in 
their own way, as the saying goes. 

Divine magic also provides a means of communing 
with the gods and can be used to call upon their guid- 
ance. Divine pronouncements of this sort are often 
personal in scope and brief, and those edicts that con- 
cern broader matters tend to be open to interpretation 
or debate. 


Priesthood 

Priesthood is a vocation like any other, with those who 
undertake it often honing their abilities through a sys- 
tem of apprenticeship. At a small temple, a novice or 
an acolyte might study under the only priest available. 
Larger temples can accommodate groups of acolytes, 
each learning under the direction of one or more men- 
tors responsible for training them in the duties and 
skills of the priesthood. 

Once acolytes complete their education, they are often 
ordained in a ritual in which a successful candidate is 
invested with the responsibilities of the priesthood. 

Conflicts and Persecution 

The moral and ethical values of the deities in Faerun 
run the gamut, representing all the outlooks that their 
mortal followers demonstrate, from the principled 
agents of good to the vicious proponents of evil. Most 
cultures and societies aren’t nearly as cosmopolitan as 
the population of Faerun taken as a whole; as a result, 
religious persecution (from the viewpoint of those who 
garner the attention) is practiced in places where wor- 
ship of certain deities is frowned on. 

Most governments that engage in persecution limit 
such restrictions to the establishment of formal temples, 
priesthoods, and organized festivals. (On a practical 
level, it’s impossible to prevent individuals from innoc- 
uously or secretly worshiping whichever deities they 
choose.) For instance, although worship of Talona— like 
that of many evil gods— is forbidden in Waterdeep, this 
prohibition extends only to the creation of a temple and 
the presence of her priesthood within the city. Individual 
citizens or families who revere Talona might be viewed 
as misguided, but they aren’t taken into custody or pun- 
ished as long as they obey the laws of the city. 

Some places take this form of persecution a step 
further, for a variety of reasons. A tyrant might outlaw 
worship of Torm, lest it inspire rebellion, and an other- 
wise fair-minded mayor of a river-mill community might 
demand that worshipers of Silvanus find elsewhere to

Divine Magic 

The gods show their favor toward mortals in myriad 
ways. A chosen few have their minds and souls opened 
to the power of magic. There is no formula for who does 
and doesn’t receive this divine insight, as the gods keep 
their own counsel concerning their selections. Some 
who are favored seek to ignore or deny their gift, while 
others embrace it wholeheartedly. 

Some who display the potential for divine magic de- 
velop and practice their abilities in a temple, a sacred 
grove, or some other spiritual place, perhaps in the 
company of other students. Other practitioners of divine 
magic discover and nurture their gods-given power en- 
tirely on their own. 


The Gods of Faerun 

The gods that make up the pantheon of Faerun are 
much like the population of some of the Realms’ great- 
est cities: an eclectic blend of individuals from a variety 
of sources. The makeup of the pantheon has shifted 
over the ages, as a result of changes in the Realms and 
its people (or vice versa, depending on which scholars 
you believe). The following pages describe the most 
prominent members of the pantheon. 

The deities of the Faerunian pantheon are by no 
means the only powers worshiped in the Realms. The 
nonhuman races have pantheons of their own (de- 
scribed in chapter 3), and scattered other cults and local 
divinities can be found across Faerun.

Amaunator 

The Keeper of the Eternal Sun , the Light of Law, the 
Yellow God 

The rule of law and the glory of the sun are both in Am- 
aunator’s dominion. His priests help establish bureau- 
cracies and lawful order in communities. They often wit- 
ness contracts and signed agreements, stamping such 
documents with the sun-symbol of Amaunator to signify 
their validity. 

His priests teach that Amaunator has died and been 
reborn time and again. Like the sun, he might pass into 
the realm of darkness, but inevitably his bright gaze 
will fall on the world once again. Amaunator is seen 
as a stern and unforgiving deity, not unlike Silvanus in 
comportment, but his concern isn’t for the balance of 
life— he cares that things proceed according to the ce- 
lestial order, that promises are kept, and that the rule of 
law persists. 



Symbol of Amaunator 


CHAPTER 1 I WELCOME TO THE REALMS 


Farmers and travelers beseech him when they pray 
for rain or sun, as do any others looking for a favorable 
change in the weather. But the most common form of 
propitiation to Amaunator is the practice of swearing 
oaths, signing contracts, and declaring laws under the 
light of the sun. So ingrained in the common perception 
is the connection between a solemn oath and the sun 
that those engaged in closing deals or issuing edicts 
often pause and wait for a passing cloud to clear the sun 
before completing the transaction or pronouncement. 

Asmodeus 

The Lord of the Ninth, The Cloven, Old Hoof and Horn 

Open worship of Asmodeus began roughly a century 
ago when small cults with charismatic leaders sprang 
up in the aftermath of the Spellplague. That catastrophe 
left many asking why the gods were angry or had aban- 
doned them. To those questioners, the faithful of Asmo- 
deus provided answers and a god who would forgive all 







their faults. Still, for the next few decades, the cult of 
Asmodeus struggled for acceptance. 

In the beliefs of the people of the North— which 
coincide with many tales told by dwarves, elves, and 
others— Asmodeus is Lord of the Ninth, the leader of 
all devils of the Nine Hells. People know devils to be 
iron-minded and silver-tongued purveyors of temptation, 
whose price for their boons can be as dear as one’s 
soul. It’s said that when a soul waits on the Fugue Plane 
for a deity to take it to its appropriate afterlife, devils 
approach the soul and offer it a chance at power and im- 
mortal pleasures. All a soul needs to do is take one step 
out of the dust and the milling crowd and put a foot on 
the first rung of the infernal ladder that represents the 
hierarchy of the Nine Hells. 

The faithful of Asmodeus acknowledge that devils 
offer their worshipers a path that’s not for everyone— 
just as eternally basking in the light of Lathander or 
endlessly swinging a hammer in the mines of Moradin 
might not be for everyone. Those who serve Asmodeus 
in life hope to be summoned out of the moaning masses 
of the Fugue Plane after death. They yearn for the 
chance to master their own fates, with all of eternity to 
achieve their goals. 

To those not so dedicated, priests of Asmodeus offer 
the prospect of a reprieve in the afterlife. All souls wait 
on the Fugue Plane for a deity’s pleasure, which deter- 
mines where a soul will spend the rest of eternity. Those 
who lived their lives most in keeping with a deity’s out- 
look are taken first. Others, who have transgressed in 
the eyes of their favored god or have not followed any 
particular ethos, might wait centuries before Kelemvor 
judges where they go. People who fear such a fate can 
pray to Asmodeus, his priests say, and in return a devil 
will grant a waiting soul some comfort. 

Today, shrines to Asmodeus are still rare and temples 
are almost unheard of, but many folk have adopted the 
habit of asking Asmodeus for reprieve from their sins. 
After transgressing against a god in some way, a person 
prays to Asmodeus for something to provide respite 
during the long wait. Asmodeus is known to grant peo- 
ple what they wish, and thus people pray for all the de- 
lights and distractions they desire most from life. Those 
who transgress in great ways often ask Asmodeus to 
hide their sins from the gods, and priests say that he 
will do so, but with a price after death. 


Auril 





The Frostmaiden, Lady Frostkiss, Icedawn 

Auril, the merciless goddess of cold and winter, is 
worshiped mostly in regions that are affected by deep 
winters. Folk propitiate Auril with offerings and prayers 
for mercy. Her priests warn others to prepare for winter, 
and to stock extra provisions in order to have some to 
spare as offerings to the goddess. 

Few favor Auril except for those who make their live- 
lihood from winter or those who truly love the season. 
Her rare priests tend to be folk who would, but for their 
status, likely be outcasts from their communities. They 
practice celibacy and remain aloof from others when not 
serving in their official capacity. 

Luskan has a temple dedicated to Auril, the white- 
spired Winter Palace. The structure is a roofless array 
of pillars and arches carved of white stone. The rituals 
of Auril’s worship often seem cruel to outsiders. In 
Luskan, visitors gather at the temple to watch the fre- 
quent “wet parades,” a ritual in which supplicants don 
garments packed with ice. They then journey between 
six white pillars known as the Kisses of Auril, which 
are dispersed throughout the city. The worshipers move 
from pillar to pillar, chanting prayers to the goddess. 
Upon reaching a pillar, a supplicant must climb it and 
then “kiss the lady,” touching lips to a rusty iron plate 
at the top. In winter, these events resemble frantic 
footraces, with the added risk of frostbite and injuries 
caused by falling from the slippery pillars. The parade 
runners are cheered on by patrons who come out of 
nearby taverns to place bets on the stamina of the par- 
ticipants. Those who finish the race are thought to have 
helped make the winter easier, and they rarely have to 
pay for food or ale all winter long. 


Azuth 


The High One, the Lord of Spellcraft, the First M agister 

Few pay homage to Azuth aside from wizards. For them, 
the High One is the ultimate embodiment of all that they 
hold dear. 

Mystra serves as goddess of magic; Oghma is god of 
knowledge; and Deneir is god of writing and language. 
Azuth takes aspects of these general fields and applies 
them to the specific practices of wizards. For instance, 
while Mystra is the deity who represents the soul, art, 
and wonder of magic, Azuth is god of a wizard’s long 
hours of study, exacting standards of movement and 











Symbol of Auril 



Symbol of Azuth 




CHAPTER 1 I WELCOME TO THE REALMS 


T 






speech, and cramped, ink-stained fingers. Wizards 
invoke Azuth when they scribe scrolls, inscribe magic 
circles, attempt to memorize spells, and even when they 
cast spells. Often this acknowledgment comes in the 
form of silently forming Azuth's holy symbol, pointing 
the index finger of the left hand to the sky. For many wiz- 
ards, the gesture is so commonplace in their lives that it 
becomes an unconscious habit. 

Temples dedicated to Azuth are scarce, and clerics of 
the deity are extremely rare. Even in magic-saturated 
Halruaa, only a handful of holy places are dedicated to 
Azuth. Sometimes a statue or a shrine dedicated to him 
stands in a corner of a temple to Mystra or another deity. 
More often, a wizard has a personal shrine at home. 
Azuth is represented at such sites as a hooded and 
bearded figure with left hand held high, finger pointed 
up. Sometimes he is represented by merely the hand. In 
either case, the finger often serves as a candleholder or 
as the point of origin for a light spell. 

Bane 

The Black Hand , the Lord of Darkness 

Bane has a simple ethos: the strong have not just the 
right but the duty to rule over the weak. A tyrant who 
is able to seize power must do so, for not only does the 
tyrant benefit, but so do those under the tyrant's rule. 
When a ruler succumbs to decadence, corruption, or de- 
crepitude, a stronger and more suitable ruler will rise. 

Bane is vilified in many legends. Throughout history, 
those who favor him have committed dark deeds in his 
name, but most people don't worship Bane out of mal- 
ice. Bane represents ambition and control, and those 
who have the former but lack the latter pray to him to 
give them strength. It is said that Bane favors those who 
exhibit drive and courage, and that he aids those who 
seek to become conquerors, carving kingdoms from the 
wilderness, and bringing order to the lawless. 

At many times and in many places in Faerun, the 
faithful of Bane have been seen as saviors for their ef- 
forts in slaughtering raiders, throwing down corrupt rul- 
ers, or saving armies on the brink of defeat. But in just 
as many other places, the worship of Bane has created 
or supported cruel dictatorships, aided mercantile mo- 
nopolies, or brought about the practice of slavery where 
before it didn't exist. 



CHAPTER 1 | WELCOME TO THE REALMS 


Beshaba 

The Maid of Misfortune, Lady Doom, Black Bess 

Beshaba is the counterpoint to Tymora and is just as 
frequently acknowledged in daily life as is her more be- 
nevolent “sister." She is seen as a cruel and capricious 
goddess who must be propitiated to avoid attracting her 
attention and interest in a negative way. 

Beshaba's name is invoked when someone is beset by 
bad luck— which could be as minor as stubbing a toe or 
breaking a wagon wheel, or as catastrophic as slipping 
and accidentally falling off a cliff. It is also invoked to 
ward off her attentions when someone is doing some- 
thing in which good luck wouldn’t play a part but bad 
luck might. For example, someone rolling dice would 
invoke Tymora because they want random chance to 
fall in their favor, but someone about to cross a rickety 
bridge would ask Beshaba to keep the bridge intact. 

Folk make the symbol of Beshaba by folding in their 
thumbs and extending their fingers on one or both 
hands (mimicking the horns of her holy symbol) to ward 
off misfortune. The same gesture raised to the head 
signifies a salute; when pointed at someone, the “horns" 
indicate ill favor directed toward that individual. 

Many druids worship Beshaba as one of the First 
Circle. They propitiate her with dances while wearing 
fire-blackened antlers dipped in blood. According to 
these druids, her holy symbol is the horns of a stag be- 
cause when Beshaba was first worshiped, humans were 
simple hunter-gatherers and she was believed to bring 
misfortune to hunters, such as being gored by a stag. 

Although most people tremble in fear at the prospect 
of Beshaba’s attendance at any event (even in spirit), 
Beshaba is almost always invoked and welcomed 
formally in the opening speeches or ceremonies of 
formal functions such as marriages and coronations, 
contests of sport or martial prowess, and at the naming 
ceremonies of children. If she isn’t invited to such an 
event, she might take offense and wreak misfortune on 
those involved. 

Temples to Beshaba are virtually unknown. It’s com- 
mon, however, for rural folk to erect a post and mount 
antlers on it at the site of some roadside accident or 
murder. In cities, where antlers are hard to come by and 
murders and accidents more prevalent, the fashion is to 
draw the black antlers of Beshaba with charcoal on a 
nearby wall, leaving the symbol on display until weather 
scours it away. These “shrines,” in either form, serve as 
warnings to others about places of ill fortune. 





More formal shrines to Beshaba exist in places where 
folk frequently hope to ward off misfortune. These sites 
tend to be posts or stones painted red with blackened 
antlers attached to them, or a red, triangular wall- 
mounted plaque with attached antlers. Both types have 
a stone or bronze bowl where coins can be tossed or 
burnt offerings made. The Red Wizards of Thay com- 
monly erect such shrines outside their ritual chambers 
to guard against unfortunate mistakes. 

Few dare to take Beshaba as a patron. The rare cler- 
ics of the Maid of Misfortune are those who have been 
deeply affected by great misfortunes and who seek to 
warn others of the essential unfairness of life— or to in- 
flict that unfairness upon them. 

Bhaal 

The Lord of Murder 

The folk of Faerun don’t normally pray to or acknowl- 
edge Bhaal. He is seen as a deeply evil and destructive 
deity who hungers for death— meaning the death of any 
sentient beings through unlawful means. 

Some people pray to Bhaal when they want to commit 
murder. A person might have good reason to resort to 
murder, such as when one is unable to redress some in- 
justice through lawful means. But it’s far more common 
for prayers to Bhaal to be uttered by those who seek to 
kill someone out of jealousy, greed, or wrath. It’s rare for 
anyone but assassins or compulsive killers to take Bhaal 
as a patron, and clerics who revere Bhaal often qualify 
on both counts. 

Murder cults of Bhaal have arisen in the past, each 
led by a charismatic, self-styled priest of Bhaal, but or- 
ganized worship of the Lord of Murder is extremely un- 
common. Temples and shrines are similarly rare. Those 
who erect a shrine to Bhaal usually do so to thank him 
for a successful murder. Such shrines typically feature 
a skull or a severed head surrounded by drops of blood 
(often both from the murdered victim). 

Chauntea 

The Great Mother, the Grain Goddess 

Chauntea is goddess of agriculture: sowing and reaping, 
seeding and harvest, breeding and butchery, shearing 
and weaving. In this aspect she is a rural deity rarely 
prayed to behind the walls of a city except by kitchen 
gardeners. But Chauntea is also the Great Mother, a 
goddess of crib, hearth, and home. And as such she is 


4 h 

The Earthmother 

The druids of the Moonshae Isles worship the Earth- 
mother, she who is the generative power of the land itself. 

To some mainlanders, the Earthmother is an aspect or 
manifestation of Chauntea, but to the Ffolk, she is simply 
the Earthmother, and always will be. The moonwells of the 
isles are her sacred sites and her windows onto the world. 
See “Druids” in chapter 4 for more information. 


welcomed into all homes at mealtimes and at the birth 
of children, and folk give her thanks whenever they 
experience the pleasure of settling by a fire and feeling 
safe and loved. 

Chauntea’s faith is one of nurturing and growth. Agri- 
cultural aphorisms and farming parables dot her teach- 
ings. Growing and reaping, the eternal cycle, is a com- 
mon theme in the faith. Destruction for its own sake, or 
leveling without rebuilding, is anathema to her. 

Temples of Chauntea maintain a great body of lore 
about farming and cultivation. Her priests work closely 
with communities in rural areas, and they are willing to 
roll up their sleeves and dig their hands into the dirt. 

Cyric 

The Prince of Lies, the Dark Sun 

The worship of Cyric derives directly from the story of 
his ascension to godhood. Cyric was a mortal during the 
Time of Troubles and the key to how that chaotic period 
resolved, but he was also a selfish traitor and a mur- 
derer. When he became a god, Cyric continued to work 
various plots of deceit and murder— the most famous of 
which is that, according to legend, Cyric murdered Mys- 
tra and thus caused the Spellplague over a century ago. 

Those who don’t worship Cyric see him as a god of 
madness, strife, and deceit, although his priests con- 
sider such claims to be heresy. Their Prince of Lies 
isn't a twisted madman, but a god of dark majesty who 
proves that, ultimately, all bonds between folk corrupt 
and wither away. 

Cyric’s church works openly in Amn, where the citi- 
zens espouse the principles of ambition, self-reliance, 
and “buyer beware.” Those who take Cyric as their 
patron tend to be sadists, con artists, power-mad conniv- 
ers, and worse. Other folk pray to Cyric when they want 
to do wrong but don’t want others to find out about it. 

“The Dark Sun,” originally one of Cyric’s epithets, has 
become a metaphor for strife in the Realms. “A Dark 
Sun has risen o’er this court” might be spoken as a 




warning that intrigues and infighting have gotten out of 
hand in a noble household; and married couples know to 
seek advice .from others if “a Dark Sun shines through 
the window" in their relationship. 

Deneir 

The Lord of All Glyphs and Images, the First Scribe, the 
Scribe of Oghma 

Deneir is the god of literature and literacy, the patron of 
the artist and the scribe. His is the power to accurately 
render and describe, to write and to read, and to pass 
on information. In legend, Deneir is often portrayed as 
being a scribe in service to Oghma, and he is sometimes 
thought of as Oghma’s right hand. 

Its common practice for someone who writes a let- 
ter or records information to say a prayer to Deneir to 
avoid mistakes. Similarly, artists acknowledge Deneir 
before beginning and upon completing paintings, par- 
ticularly illuminations on manuscripts, tapestries that 
relate stories, and any such attempt to use art to capture 
the truth. 

Followers of Deneir believe that information not re- 
corded and saved for later use is information lost. They 
consider literacy an important gift of the gods, one that 
should be spread and taught. His followers are scribes 
and scholars devoted, like their patron, to preserving 
written works, and also to experiencing them, for they 
say that Deneir himself is hidden within the lines, 
shapes, and passages of all written works. Priests of 
Deneir take an oath of charity as well, compelling them 
to accept the requests of others to write letters and tran- 
scribe information. 

The gods followers tend to be individualists, united 
by their shared faith but not overly concerned with reli- 
gious hierarchy and protocol. This behavior is supported 
by the fact that Deneir’s blessings of divine magic are 
more often bestowed on those who lose themselves in 
written works than on those who fancy themselves part 
of any temple or religious order. Contemplation of the 
faith’s most holy book, the Tome of Universal Harmony, 
is the most effective way to become deserving of Dene- 
ir’s blessings. 


Eldath 




Symbol of Deneir 


The Quiet One, the Guardian of Groves, the Mother of 
the Waters 

Eldath is the goddess of waterfalls, springs, pools, still- 
ness, peace, and quiet glades. She is thought to be pres- 
ent at many such places, particularly those that serve as 
druid groves. Eldath is a goddess of comfort, healing, 
and calm. Her blessed waters heal the sick, cure mad- 
ness, and comfort the dying. 

Most rural places have a pond or a glade that locals 
ascribe to Eldath. Tradition dictates that it be a place of 
quiet reflection where others are left to their thoughts. A 
body of water such as a pond or a spring typically serves 
as a repository of offerings. If the holy site is a glade, a 
stream one crosses along the way might serve as the re- 
pository, or a prominent bush or tree in the glade might 
be the place where people tie offerings. Typical offerings 
are broken weapons or items that are remembrances of 
arguments, which the faithful discard while making a 
wish for peace in the future. Many of those who favor El- 
dath are pacifists or people who are troubled by violence 
they have witnessed or experienced. 

Eldath’s priests don’t organize into large sects. Indeed, 
many are itinerant, wandering between various holy 
sites and shrines, seeing that the locations are cared 
for and that they remain places of sweet serenity. The 
faithful of Eldath are usually close to nature, and allied 
to druids, who count Eldath among the First Circle. It 
is taboo to strike a priest of Eldath, and killing one is 
said to bring great misfortune. Despite the measure of 
protection that this belief affords them, most priests of 
Eldath avoid conflicts rather than attempting to quell 
them. Those who serve Eldath are happy to preside over 
peaceful negotiations and to certify treaties, but they 
can’t force others to engage in harmony. 

Gond 

The Wonderbringer, the Inspiration Divine, the Holy 
Maker of All Things 

Gond is the god of artifice, craft, and construction. He is 
revered by blacksmiths, woodworkers, engineers, and 
inventors. Anyone who is crafting something might say 
a prayer to Gond to guide the work, but folk know that 
Gond smiles most brightly upon new inventions that 
others find useful. 

Priests of Gond wander the North dressed in saffron 
vestments, adorned with sashes that contain within

CHAPTER 1 | WELCOME TO THE REALMS 





their folds gears, locks, hooks, and bits of steel, tin, and 
wood that might prove useful in a pinch. They also wear 
belts of large, linked metal medallions and enormous 
sun hats. A traveling priest of Gond offers services to 
distant villages as a tinker, a carpenter, and a civil engi- 
neer rolled into one, ready to help build a better paddock 
gate, dig a new well, or mend pots or furniture that 
might otherwise go to waste. All priests of Gond keep 
journals in which they record ideas, inventions, and in- 
novations discovered in their travels, and take great de- 
light in meeting fellow priests and sharing their finds. In 
large cities, the Gondar construct temples that serve as 
great workshops and inventors’ labs. Wandering priests 
turn their journals over to the resident scribes at such 
temples, who then record the priests’ observations for 
posterity and the benefit of all. 

Most who favor Gond practice time-honored crafting 
professions: they are smiths and engineers, architects 
and weavers, leatherworkers and jewelers. Even so, this 
faith has a well-earned reputation as a haven for crack- 
pot inventors and visionaries. 

The center of Gond’s worship on the Sword Coast lies 
in Baldur’s Gate, where the faithful have erected two 
huge structures in honor of the Wonderbringer: a tem- 
ple called the High House of Wonders and a museum 
of craft and design called the Hall of Wonders. Lantan 
had been the preeminent place of Gond’s worship in the 
world until a century ago, when the island nation dis- 
appeared, and since its return the few Lantanese mer- 
chants seen in Sword Coast ports have said little about 
the present state of their homeland. 

Gwaeron Windstrom 

The Mouth of Mielikki, the Master Tracker, the Tracker 
Never Led Astray 

Few aside from rangers of the North pray to Gwaeron 
Windstrom. Said to have been a mortal man elevated to 
godhood by Mielikki, Gwaeron serves rangers as their 
intercessor with Mielikki. He is seen as a master ranger, 
the perfect tracker, a peerless animal handler, and a 
dedicated foe of rapacious creatures such as trolls and 
ores. He is said to look like an old man with a long white 
beard who is still hale and mighty, and he is believed to 
take rest and sleep in a stand of trees near Triboar. 

Rangers pray to Gwaeron because he represents 
much of the work they do, and because he can speak 
to Mielikki on their behalf. In the North, most rangers 
view Mielikki as too mysterious, holy, and wild to be 


addressed directly with their requests, but they consider 
Gwaeron Windstrom to be one of them and thus under- 
standing of their needs. 

Gwaeron has no temples, but shrines dedicated to 
him can be found in many places that serve wilderness 
wanderers as trail markers. Each one is denoted by a 
carving of Gwaeron’s symbol, a paw print with a star on 
the palm, on a prominent tree or stone. 

Helm 

The Watcher, He of the Unsleeping Eyes, the Vigilant 
One 

The god of vigilance and protection, Helm is seen as the 
epitome of the guardian, the watcher, and the guard. He 
is venerated by those who need to remain watchful for 
enemies or danger. Helm is a favorite deity of people 
who make a living by protecting someone or something, 
such as bodyguards, members of the city watch, and the 
guards of a treasury vault. 

Helm embodies the spirit of watchfulness without 
regard to good or evil. In legends, he is honorable and 
keeps his word to a fault, such as when he guarded 
the celestial stairways during the Time of Troubles, 
preventing the gods from ascending them and continu- 
ing the chaos of that period, until the Tablets of Fate 
were found. 

Although his faith has known dark days, worship of 
Helm never truly faded away. Most of his followers be- 
lieve that the Watcher can never be vanquished utterly, 
and recent events have borne out that assertion. 

Helm’s priests teach that one must be ever vigilant, 
ever aware, ever prepared for one’s enemies. Patience, 
clear thought, and careful planning will always defeat 
rushed actions in the end. Those who favor Helm strive 
to be alert, clear-headed, and true to their word. These 
traits don’t necessarily make them nice people, however, 
and as such many consider the faithful of Helm to be 
inflexible and merciless. 

Hoar 

The Doombringer, Poet of Justice 

Hoar, known in the lands along the Inner Sea as Assu- 
ran, is a god of revenge and retribution. He isn’t typically 
worshiped habitually, but his name is invoked by those 
who seek vengeance. When a guilty party falls prey to 
fate— such as when a murderer escapes prosecution, 
but is then accidentally slain himself— the hand of Hoar

is given credit. When one hears three rolls of thunder 
in succession, it is thought to be a sign from Hoar that 
some act of vengeance has been performed. Many 
human societies have the custom of ringing a bell or a 
gong three times when judgment of a crime is rendered 
or an execution takes place. 

Folk speak Hoars name when they want revenge, 
particularly when they are incapable of avenging them- 
selves. This invocation might be in response to a petty 
slight or a true injustice, and the acknowledgment of 
Hoar might be a short prayer said aloud or might be 
written down somewhere. It’s generally believed that 
the more permanent the form of the prayer, the more 
likely it is to be fulfilled. For this reason, some etch 
their prayers in lead and bury it or hide their prayers 
inside diaries. Aside from bounty hunters and those on 
crusades of vengeance, few truly revere Hoar, and he is 
served by fewer still who would call themselves priests. 
Temples or shrines of Hoar are almost nonexistent ex- 
cept for ancient sites in Chessenta and Unther. 

Hoar became a member of the Faerunian pantheon 
when his worship extended beyond the lands that origi- 
nally revered him. Most consider Tyr to be the arbiter of 
laws, and Hoar to be the god who metes out punishment 
that comes as a result of breaking those codes. A judge 
might favor the worship of Tyr, while a jailor or a heads- 
man is more likely to pray to Hoar. 


provide succor when they can, but also use force to 
put an end to torture and suffering inflicted on others. 
Ilmater’s priests travel to places where the worst pos- 
sible conditions exist, ministering to the needs of the 
oppressed, the deceased, and the poor. They put others 
ahead of themselves, are sharing of all they have, and 
emphasize the spiritual nature of life over the welfare of 
the material body. 

Priests of Ilmater who are on a quest to aid others 
can be recognized by their hair shirts, vests of coarse 
fur worn against the bare skin. It is taboo to harm such 
priests as they go about their duties, such as when they 
administer to the wounded on a battlefield. The taboo is 
so strongly felt among humans that other races respect 
the custom. Even ores and goblinoids will avoid directly 
attacking a peaceful priest of Ilmater, as long as the 
priest administers to their fallen warriors as well. 

Most folk deeply respect the work and the sacrifice 
of Ilmater’s faith, and lend aid to such endeavors where 
they can. When a temple of Ilmater sends its faithful to 
help refugees of war or victims of plague, their willing- 
ness to sacrifice their own well-being always prompts 
ordinary people to support them, whether they are in- 
spired or shamed into action. 

Jergal 

The Final Scribe, the Pitiless One, the Bleak Seneschal 


Ilmater 

The Crying God, the Rack-Broken Lord, He Who 
Endures 

Ilmater is the god of suffering, martyrdom, and perse- 
verance, renowned for his compassion and endurance. 

It is he who offers succor and calming words to those 
who are in pain, victimized, or in great need. He is the 
willing sufferer, the one who takes the place of another 
to heft the other’s burden, to take the other’s pain. He is 
the god of the oppressed and the unjustly treated. 

It is said that if he had his way, the Crying God would 
take all the suffering in the world onto himself, so as to 
spare others. Since he can’t, he blesses those who endure 
on others’ behalf, and he alleviates suffering when he can. 
Martyrs who die that others may live are always blessed 
by Ilmater with a final rest and reward in the god’s after- 
life, should they so choose. 

Ilmater’s priests take in the ill, the starving, and the 
injured, and his temples give most of what they receive 
to help offset the suffering of the world. His followers 


Legend has it that Jergal is an ancient deity. The story 
goes that in the time of Netheril he was worshiped as 
the god of death, murder, and strife. Yet with the passing 
of time, he became bored with his position. Then one 
day three mortals, each a powerful adventurer, met Jer- 
gal in the lands of the dead, determined to destroy him 
and take his power. Instead, Jergal calmly abdicated his 
throne of bones and allowed each of the three mortals to 
take part of his divinity. Thus it was that Bane assumed 
the portfolio of strife, Myrkul the rulership of the dead, 
and Bhaal the portfolio of murder. Jergal lost his former 
stature and became a scribe of the dead. 

Jergal is now seen as an uncaring custodian of the 
dead. He is thought to record the passing of the living 
and to aid Kelemvor in seeing that souls are properly 
bound to their appropriate afterlife. He is rarely ac- 
knowledged directly, except for being mentioned at 
funerals and among those who practice the custom of 
writing the name of the deceased on a sheet of parch- 
ment and placing it in the corpse’s mouth. This rite is

The Legend of Knucklebones, Skull Bowling, and the Empty Throne 


Long ago there was but one god of strife, death, and the 
dead, and he was known as jergal, Lord of the End of Every- 
thing. jergal fomented and fed on the discord among mortals 
and deific entities alike. When beings slew each other in their 
quest for power or in their hatred, he welcomed them into 
his shadowy kingdom of eternal gloom. As all things died, 
everything came to him eventually, and over time he built a 
kingdom unchallenged by any other god. But he grew tired of 
his duties, for he knew them too well, and without challenge 
there is nothing — and in nothingness there is only gloom. 

In such a state, the difference between absolute power and 
absolute powerlessness is -undetectable. 

During this dark era arose three powerful mortals — Bane, 
Bhaal, and Myrkul — who lusted after the power Jergal pos- 
sessed. The trio forged an unholy pact that they would gain 
such ultimate power or die in the attempt. Over the length 
and breadth of the world they strode, seeking powerful magic 
and spells and defying death at every turn. No matter what 
monster they confronted or what spells they braved, the three 
mortals emerged unscathed at every turn. Eventually, the 
trio journeyed into the Gray Waste and sought out the Castle 
of Bone. Through armies of skeletons, legions of zombies, 
hordes of wraiths, and a gauntlet of liches they battled. 
Eventually they reached the object of their lifelong quest — the 
Bone Throne. 

“I claim this throne of evil,” Bane the tyrant shouted 
to Jergal. 

“I’ll destroy you before you can raise a finger,” threatened 
Bhaal the assassin. 

“And I shall imprison your essence for eternity,” promised 
Myrkul the necromancer. 

Jergal arose from his throne with a weary expression and 
said, “The throne is yours. I have grown weary of this empty 
power. Take it if you wish — I promise to serve and guide 
you as your seneschal until you grow comfortable with the 
position.” Then, before the stunned trio could react, the Lord 
of the Dead asked, “Who among you shall rule?” 

The trio immediately fell to fighting among themselves 
while Jergal looked on with indifference. When eventually 
it appeared that either they would all die of exhaustion or 


battle on for an eternity, the Lord of the End of Everything 
intervened. 

“After all you have sacrificed, would you come away with 
nothing? Why don’t you divide the portfolios of the office by 
engaging in a game of skill for them?” asked Jergal. 

Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul considered the god’s offer and 
agreed to it. So Jergal took the skulls of his three most pow- 
erful liches and gave them to the trio so they could compete 
in skull bowling. Each mortal rolled a skull across the Gray 
Waste, having agreed that the winner would be he who 
bowled the farthest. 

Malar the Beastlord arrived to visit Jergal at this moment. 
After quickly ascertaining that the winner of the contest would 
receive all of Jergal’s power, he chased off after the three 
skulls to make sure that the contest would be halted until he 
had a chance to participate for part of the prize. Bane, Bhaal, 
and Myrkul again fell to fighting, as it was obvious their sport 
had been ruined, but again Jergal intervened. “Why don’t you 
allow Lady Luck to decide, so you don’t have to share with 
the Beast?” 

The trio agreed to this alternative, and Jergal broke off his 
skeletal finger bones and gave them to the contestants. When 
Malar returned from chasing the skulls, he found that the trio 
had just finished a game of knucklebones. 

Bane cried out triumphantly, “As winner, I choose to rule 
for all eternity as the ultimate tyrant. I can induce hatred and 
strife at my whim, and all will bow down before me while in 
my kingdom.” 

Myrkul, who had won second place, declared, “But I choose 
the dead, and by doing so I truly win, because all that you are 
lord over, Bane, will eventually be mine. All things must die — 
even gods.” 

Bhaal, who finished third, proclaimed, “I choose death, and 
it is by my hand that all that you rule, Lord Bane, will eventu- 
ally pass to Lord Myrkul. Both of you must pay honor to me 
and obey my wishes, since I can destroy your kingdom, Bane, 
by murdering your subjects, and I can starve your kingdom, 
Myrkul, by staying my hand.” 

Malar growled in frustration, but could do nothing, and so 
yet again only the beasts were left for him. 

And Jergal merely smiled, for he had been delivered. 


common in places where an individual’s grave or tomb 
isn’t marked with the person’s name. 

Few people favor Jergal as a deity, and most who do 
are concerned with the dispensation of the dead in some 
way. Priests of Jergal serve communities as undertakers 
and caretakers of gravesites. Jergal has no temples ded- 
icated to him aside from abandoned places devoted to 
his old, darker incarnation, but his priests are welcome 
in the temples of Kelemvor, Deneir, and Myrkul. His 


faithful send their annual recordings of mortality to holy 
sites where records of that sort are kept. 

Kelemvor 

The Lord of the Dead , the Judge of the Damned 

Kelemvor is seen as a just, fair, and comforting god of 
death. Death comes to all, and when it occurs Kelemvor 
is there to take each soul by the hand and lead it to the 



CHAPTER 1 | WELCOME TO THE REALMS 


proper afterlife. Kelemvor’s priests teach that those who 
revere the gods according to the rites of their religion 
have done their proper service and will be offered the 
afterlife they seek. 

The faithful of Kelemvor provide people with peaceful 
transitions into the care of the Lord of the Dead. They 
help the dying put their affairs in order, and they offici- 
ate at funeral rites for those who can’t afford the lavish 
ceremonies of their faith. The tenets of Kelemvor’s 
faithful compel them to forestall or prevent untimely 
deaths whenever possible. Different sects and worship- 
ers define “untimely” in different ways. One group might 
concentrate on stopping the spread of disease, another 
on the prevention of murder, and yet another on elimi- 
nating the scourge of the undead. In fact, all the faithful 
of Kelemvor despise the undead and work to some 
degree to eliminate them, for undead of any sort are 
seen as an abomination of the natural order. This belief 
obviously puts Kelemvor’s faithful at odds with necro- 
mancers, priests of Myrkul, and others who promote the 
creation of the undead, and it also causes conflict from 
unexpected sources. For instance, priests of Kelemvor 
routinely destroy any writings about the creation of the 
undead that they find — an act that offends those who 
value knowledge for its own sake, such as the faithful of 
Oghma and Deneir. And there also exist undead that ar- 
en’t evil, such as the baelnorn, which the elves consider 
holy. Kelemvor’s devotees seek the end of such beings 
regardless of that fact. 

Lathander 

The Morninglord, Inspiration's Dawn , the Rose-and- 
Gold God 

Lathander is the god of the spring, birth, and renewal, a 
deity of conception, vitality, youth, renewal, and self-per- 
fection. He is god not of the sun but of the dawn, which 
represents the start of a new day filled with potential. 

Lathander is a god of beginnings. People commonly 
offer a prayer to him before undertaking any journey or 
endeavor. Lathander’s name is invoked to seal alliances 
and christen new ventures or companies. As a result, 
the god is very popular among the merchant classes, 
and the church has benefited accordingly. 

The rising sun is his symbol, and his colors are the 
rose, gold, and violet of the dawn. Lathander’s temples 
and shrines host a wide range of functions both munic- 
ipal and personal. At such places folk get married in 
dawn ceremonies, announce the start of civic projects, 


Symbol of Lathander 


and even give birth when possible, to provide the baby 
good fortune. 

The faithful of Lathander embrace the founding of 
new communities and the growth of civilization, as long 
as that civilization gives everyone the potential to suc- 
ceed. They despise the undead, seeing them as both a 
corruption of the natural order and a disavowal of new 
beginnings, because undead cling to their old existence 
rather than moving on. 

Leira 


The Lady of the Mists, Mistshadow ; the Lady of 
Deception 

Leira has worn many masks, and more than once has 
been thought to be dead or to be another deity alto- 
gether. Perhaps such a reputation is only natural for the 
goddess of illusion and deception. Her faithful agree 
that whatever the “truth” might be, their Lady takes 
great delight in the confusion sown by her various incar- 
nations. Even the faithful of Cyric once taught that their 
god killed Leira, but now they espouse the strange idea 
that somehow she is his daughter. 

Leira isn’t viewed as malicious or as a trickster but is 
seen as enigmatic, quiet, and retiring. She is credited 
with inventing Ruathlek, the language of illusionists and 
the spoken tongue of Nimbral. 

The faithful of Leira seem to be scarce, although it 
is difficult to know this for certain, because those who 
favor her rarely make their inclinations known. Leira 
is the patron of illusionists and liars. She receives little 
regular worship except from illusionists, who pray to the 
Mistshadow for potency in their magic, and con artists, 
for whom she is a kind of champion. Most people pray to 
her when they hope to keep something secret, or placate 
her with a prayer before making an important decision 
when they fear being deceived. Some folk perform a 
swirling motion with a finger behind their backs when 
telling a lie as a way of beseeching her for aid. 

Her priests wear vestments of white and mist-gray, 
and their faces are covered by smooth, featureless 
masks. Only in Nimbral do temples to Leira exist, and 
shrines dedicated to her found across the continent are 
usually disguised as-other kinds of sites, marked with 
signs that only the faithful would recognize. 


CHAPTER 1 | WELCOME TO THE REALMS 




Symbol of Leira 


Lliira 

Our Lady of Joy, Joybringer, the Mistress of Revels 

Lliira is a beloved goddess, a deity of contentment, re- 
lease, joy, happiness, dance, and freedom. As the patron 
of festivals, she is honored at any celebration, and dance 
is the primary way to worship her. The Mistress of Rev- 
els is said to abhor violence, and any fighting or drawing 
of weapons (except in ceremony) at a celebration will 
cause her to withhold her favor. Her priests and priest- 
esses, known as joybringers, take it as their mission to 
make other people happy, even if just for a moment. 

Her faithful always wear at least one clothing item of 
a bright, cheerful color, and her priests’ vestments have 
more in common with festival attire than with somber 
ecclesial garments. Rubies and sapphires are sacred to 
Our Lady of Joy, and her priests bless anyone they see 
wearing such adornments. 

Lliira’s followers aren’t frivolous, however. To them, 
divine joy is a very real gift to the world of mortals, and 
one much needed. To that end, they fight those who 
would bring misery to others. They are fierce against 
their foes, and joyous revelers when their work is done. 

Loviatar 

The Maiden of Pain, the Scourge Mistress, the Willing Whip 

Pain isn’t a means to an end for Loviatar’s faithful, but 
an end unto itself. To them, nothing is as transcendent 
as suffering, and all pain is holy, from the crudest bar- 
barism, to the most sublime torture, to the emotional 
suffering of the heartbroken or the betrayed. 

The pain that one feels is proof of the Lady’s attention, 
and so her faithful are notorious self-flagellants. Pain 
is also a path to power, in terms of both one’s ability to 
inflict it and one’s ability to endure it. A cold, cruel de- 
meanor is considered ideal because it best emulates the 
Scourge Mistress, and for the same reason her faithful 
appreciate beauty, cultural refinement, and a certain 
adeptness at manipulation. 

Though temples to Loviatar are rare, her faithful are 
more numerous than might be expected. Loviatar is 
the chosen deity of those who inflict pain as a matter 
of course, including torturers and others who need to 
break the will of their victims. She is favored by sadists 
and masochists, and some of her followers form cultish 
cells of secret adherents. Each of these groups is led by 
someone who takes pleasure in administering pain and 


dominating others, supported and backed up by a num- 
ber of submissive sycophants. 

Worshipers of Loviatar rarely gather in numbers ex- 
cept in the more populous cities. When small cadres of 
faithful operate quietly in such places, few citizens take 
notice or raise a fuss if they do witness cult activity. The 
sufferers who endure the lash, however, aren’t always 
willing participants, and Lovatar's cults sometimes op- 
erate secret slavery rings, which can draw the attention 
of the authorities. The open worship of Loviatar and 
temples clearly dedicated to her are rarely seen except 
in lands where slavery is an accepted practice. 

Malar 

The Beastlord, the Black-Blooded One 

Malar epitomizes the dark side of nature, the world that 
is red in tooth and claw. His faithful believe the hunt is 
the center point between life and death— the facing off 
of hunter and prey, forcing the issue of who lives and 
who dies. People believe that Malar can’t be propitiated 
and knows no mercy, so he receives prayers only from 
those engaging in a hunt. Such supplicants pray to Ma- 
lar for two reasons: to beg the aid of his peerless skill 
as a hunter, or to adopt his fearsome mantle and thus 
ward off other predators. Malar is the god of those who 
delight in the hunt, don’t shy from bloodshed, and savor 
the fear of their prey. 

Many lycanthropes consider Malar to be their divine 
father, as do some other intelligent predators. He has 
many devotees who are druids and rangers of partic- 
ularly savage inclination, and many barbarians take 
Malar as a patron for his ferocity and cruelty. His priests 
use claw bracers, impressive gauntlets bedecked with 
stylized claws that jut out from the ends of the fists, as 
ceremonial weapons. 

Mask 

The Lord of Shadows, the Master of All Thieves 

Mask is a trickster god, the patron of ne’er-do-wells, 
spies, and thieves. All that occurs within shadow is in 
the purview of Mask. People whisper a prayer to Mask 
whenever stealth is required or intrigue is afoot. Court- 
iers and diplomats invoke the god’s name in hopes of a 
smooth negotiation. 

Those who favor Mask usually pursue thievery and 
other forms of acquisition of what belongs to others, 
such as pickpocketing, burglary, mugging, and con 





33 



games. Ordinary folk pray to him to avert his eyes from 
their valuables, but the cautious sometimes employ 
“Mask’s purse,” a small, cheap cloth pouch worn in plain 
sight (thus easily cut or lifted) containing a small offer- 
ing of coin. By convention, a pickpocket pilfers Mask’s 
purse when encountering another person wearing one, 
and considers the gain a gift from the god, while the one 
who lost the purse is grateful to the Lord of Shadows for 
accepting a respectful sacrifice of a small portion of his 
goods. Of course, nothing prevents another pickpocket 
from targeting someone who has lost Mask’s purse, but 
anyone with the ill luck to attract multiple pickpockets in 
a single outing has probably earned Mask’s ire anyway. 

Priests of Mask are usually thieves by profession, and 
often serve as higher-ups in the local underworld or 
criminal syndicate. They go by the title of demarche or 
demarchess, and wear veil-masks when acting in their 
priestly capacity. 

Mielikki 


Our Lady of the Forest, the Forest Queen 

People rarely speak of Mielikki except in quiet forest 
spaces. Woodlands that evoke wonder are where she 
reigns supreme, but she is said to keep watch over good 
folk in any forest, not matter how dark or cruel. When 
children are lost in the woods, people beseech Mielikki 
to protect them until they are found. 

Mielikki is the goddess of the forest and the creatures 
that live within it. She is seen as a remote and spiritual 
deity— less human-like than many other gods. She’s 
not unmindful of people, but her attention and favor 
are difficult to attract. She is the patron of rangers in 
the same way that Milil is the patron of bards, but even 
rangers rarely pray to her directly. They instead pray to 
Gwaeron Windstrom, who they believe will carry their 
words to the goddess by tracking her to whichever forest 
she hides in. 

Mielikki’s symbol is a unicorn, which prompts some to 
think of her as such and conflate her with Lurue, Queen 
of the Unicorns and the actual goddess of their kind. But 
most tales depict Mielikki as a beautiful woman whom 
Lurue allows upon her back as a rider, and the two are 
thought to be boon companions. Mielikki’s relationships 
with other deities of the natural world are more com- 
plex. Silvanus is sometimes thought of as her father and 
Eldath is considered her sister, but Mielikki walks her 
own path through the wilds. 



Symbol of Mask 


She has many shrines, particularly in the Savage 
Frontier. Most consist of a dead tree trunk into which 
has been carved a likeness of her holy symbol, a uni- 
corn’s head. Alternatively, the likeness might be carved 
on a separate piece of wood and tacked to a living 
tree. These shrines typically mark the point in a forest 
beyond which locals know not to cut timber or hunt. 
Often these tributes are created by loggers at the end 
of a logging excursion as a mark of thanks to the god- 
dess for providing the wood and for keeping the timber 
cutters safe during the work. 

Milil 


The Lord of Song, the One True Hand of All-Wise 
Oghma 

Milil is the god of poetry, eloquence, and song. He is 
a god of creativity and inspiration, of the entire song 
more than just the lyrics or the music. He represents 
the finished thought, the result of the process that takes 
an idea from conception to realization. Milil is most 
venerated by bards, troubadours, and other entertain- 
ers, but anyone preparing to entertain or speak before 
a crowd might offer Milil a brief prayer for a successful 
performance. Those who seek inspiration in a creative 
endeavor also pray to Milil. 

His icons depict him as a handsome male, sometimes 
a human, sometimes an elf, and even a half-elf in places 
(such as Aglarond) that have a large half-elf population. 
He is variously depicted as young or old. but his identity 
is always apparent because of his five-stringed harp 
made of silvery leaves, which he carries constantly. He 
is the ideal to which all performers aspire: poised and 
confident, winningly charismatic, and a source of in- 
spiration for those who listen to him. He is said to have 
total recall of anything he hears or that is spoken while 
music plays, as well as utmost skill at improvisation. 

Holy sites dedicated to Milil are often found in per- 
formance venues and schools of music. Whether the 
site is a vast concert hall or a small choral chamber, it 
must have excellent acoustic qualities. Milil’s priests 
are patrons of the arts in addition to being performers 
themselves, and they frequently act as tutors in the arts 
of performance at his shrines and temples. 

Like Deneir, Milil is sometimes thought of as being 
in service to Oghma. In these portrayals of the deity, 
Milil is the god’s left hand, also referred to as the One 
True Hand. This expression isn’t meant to denigrate 
the right hand (Deneir); rather, it stems from the fact 


CHAPTER 1 ! WELCOME TO THE REALMS 



Symbol of Mielikki 




that left-handedness is more often associated with great 
artistic ability and the belief that the greatest art comes 
from the acceptance of truth. 

Myrkul 

The Lord of Bones, Old Lord Skull, the Reaper 

Myrkul is an ancient god, one of three former mortals 
who were raised to deityhood when Jergal grew weary of 
his divine duties and distributed his influence between 
them. Myrkul became the god of death and the dead, 
and ruled over the City of the Dead for centuries until 
he, in turn, was slain. In time Myrkul returned, for can 
death itself truly ever die? Myrkul’s faithful see him as 
the Reaper, who lays claim to souls and brings them to 
Kelemvor to be judged. 

Myrkul is a deity of death, decay, old age, exhaustion, 
dusk, and autumn. Hes the god of the ending of things 
and hopelessness, as much as Lathander is the god of 
beginnings and hope. Folk don’t pray to Myrkul so much 
as dread him and blame him for aching bones and fading 
vision. Myrkul is thought to be passionless and uncaring 
even of his most devout worshipers. Those who take 
Myrkul as a patron tend to be morose, taciturn, and ob- 
sessed with the dead and the undead. Like many follow- 
ers of Kelemvor and Jergal, priests of Myrkul serve as un- 
dertakers and typically keep their patron’s identity secret. 

Shrines to Myrkul or engravings of his holy symbol 
appear in many places where humans bury their dead, 
but full-fledged temples are rare. The few that exist are 
hallowed places where the dead from hundreds of miles 
around are brought for internment, even if they were not 
of Myrkul’s faith. There is little space set aside for the 
living in such a location, usually a single modest shrine, 
but its catacombs and ossuaries are vast. In the deepest 
chamber of each temple rests a throne, and upon that 
throne sits the doomwarden— the preserved corpse 
of the most revered saint in the history of the temple 
(often its founder). Initiates to the faith are brought to 
kneel before a temple’s doomwarden, where they must 
spend a night and a day fasting and meditating in com- 
plete darkness. 

Mystra 

The Lady of Mysteries, Our Lady of Spells, the Mother 
of All Magic 

Mystra is the goddess of magic, and with that the god- 
dess of possibilities. She is venerated by mages and by 


those who use magic or magical objects in their daily 
lives. She also receives the prayers of those who find 
magic wondrous or encounter magic they fear. Mystra is 
the goddess of the essential force that makes all spell- 
casting possible. She provides and tends the Weave, the 
conduit through which mortal spellcasters and magical 
crafters can safely access the raw force of magic. 

The faith of Mystra is pervasive in Faerun, which is to 
be expected for a land as touched by magic as it is. Her 
worshipers include those who use magic or work closely 
with it, such as alchemists and sages. The blue-clad 
priests of Mystran temples count wizards and sorcerers 
among their numbers, as well as the occasional bard. 
The goal of Mystra’s faithful is simple: that magic be 
preserved and promulgated throughout the Realms. 

It isn’t unusual for her followers to keep an eye out for 
those who demonstrate high potential for using magic 
and help arrange for such persons to find tutelage with a 
suitable mentor. 

Oghma 

The Binder, the Lord of Knowledge 

Oghma is the god of inspiration, invention, and knowl- 
edge. Above all else, Oghma represents knowledge 
in its most supreme, raw form— the idea. An aphorism 
cited by his faithful about this concept serves them as 
a prayer when it is repeated aloud: “An idea has no heft 
but it can move mountains. An idea has no authority 
but it can dominate people. An idea has no strength but 
it can push aside empires. Knowledge is the greatest 
tool of the mortal mind, outweighing anything made by 
mortal hands. Before anything else can exist, the idea 
must exist.” 

Oghma’s faithful spread knowledge and literacy as 
widely as possible, believing that minds ought never to 
be shackled by ignorance and thus not be able to be- 
queath the benefit they might otherwise provide their 
fellows. Not surprisingly, those who follow Oghma op- 
pose those who foster deceit, trickery, and ignorance. 

Folk of many professions favor the Binder: wizards, 
cartographers, artists, bards, clerks, inventors, sages, 
scribes, and all manner of others who uncover, pre- 
serve, and create knowledge and learning. The worship 
of Oghma was, at one point, one of the few organized 
faiths in Faerun that had an established orthodoxy and 
a complete network of temples that adhered to that or- 
thodoxy. Schisms during the Time of Troubles shattered 
that network, and now the structures that house the

faith are individual temples or small networks of allied 
temples, much in the manner of other faiths. 

The Red Knight 

The Lady of Strategy, the Crimson General, the 
Grandmaster of the Lanceboard 

The Red Knight is the goddess of planning and strategy. 
Those who favor her call themselves the Red Fellow- 
ship. They believe wars are won by the best planning, 
strategy, and tactics. The worship of the Red Knight is 
filled with doctrine about strategy, such as: “Every war 
is a series of battles. Losing one doesn’t mean losing 
the war.’’ “In war, plan for peace. In peace, plan for war.” 
“Seek allies among your enemy’s enemies.” 

Worship of the Red Knight arose among a hero-ven- 
erating monastic order of Tempus in Tethyr shortly 
after the Time of Troubles. The Red Knight has since 
grown in popularity because of what her followers call 
the Great Stratagem: for decades, her priests have been 
traveling to places of warfare to educate generals and 
kings in the arts of strategy and battlefield tactics. Many 
of the leaders they approached turned them away at 
first, but it soon became apparent that those who ac- 
cepted the counsel of the Crimson General’s followers 
gained a distinct benefit. Grateful victors built temples to 
the Lady of Strategy, and gradually her faith spread. 

Today, followers of the Red Knight can be found in 
nearly any land that has seen warfare in the past cen- 
tury. Worshipers of the Red Knight are rare in the gen- 
eral population, but those who revere her can frequently 
be found among high-ranking commanders of armies, 
instructors in colleges of war, quartermasters, and the 
authors of tomes of strategy. Each temple to the Red 
Knight includes an altar dedicated to Tempus, and so 
such a place is likely to be frequented by mercenaries 
and soldiers. A temple is surrounded by a vast pavilion 
and courtyard, which can be rented by companies of 
soldiers and mercenaries for practice and training. Her 
priests believe that drilling one’s troops in a temple 
courtyard is a form of propitiation that the Red Knight 
looks upon with special favor. 

Savras 

The All-Seeing, the Third Eye, Divination s Lord 

Savras is a god of divination and fortunetelling. Few 
people worship him, but many pray to him when per- 
forming small rituals of foresight. For example, young 


men and women sometimes attempt to divine the names 
of their future spouses by saying a rhyming chant that 
calls upon Savras while gazing in a mirror. 

Savras has no currently active temples in Faerun, and 
his shrines are few and far between, tucked away in the 
corners of libraries and scriptoria. Despite this lack of 
prominence, certain folk pay regular homage to Savras, 
including investigators, diviners, judges, and others 
who have a need to uncover the truth. Such individuals 
can sometimes be identified by the elaborate staffs they 
carry in homage to Savras. According to legend, Savras 
was trapped in Azuth’s staff for ages. Azuth eventually 
freed Savras so long as Savras swore fealty, and today 
the staff is a potent symbol for those who revere Savras. 
Devout worshipers take great pains to decorate and em- 
bellish their staffs, each hoping that Savras might find it 
a welcoming place to stop for a time. 

Selune 

Our Lady of Silver, the Moonmaiden, the Night White Lady 

Selune is thought to be among the most ancient of 
Faerun’s deities. Most humans in Faerun consider the 
moon in the sky to literally be the goddess gazing down 
on the world, and the trailing motes of light behind it her 
tears. She is also a goddess of stars and navigation as 
well as motherhood and reproductive cycles. She is seen 
as a calm power, frequently venerated by female humans 
as well as by a mix of other folk: navigators and sailors, 
those who work honestly at night, those seeking protec- 
tion in the dark, the lost, and the questing. 

There are many legends about Selune, chief among 
them being the tale of the battle at the beginning of 
time between Selune and her sister, Shar. The Tears of 
Selune, the cluster of starry lights that follow the moon 
around the sky, are thought to be brought about by the 
goddess’s joy, sorrow, or both. 

Milk, a symbol of motherhood, is used in many rites 
performed by the worshipers of Selune, as are trances 
and meditation. Those who favor her typically set a bowl 
of milk outside on each night of the full moon. 

Shar 

The Mistress of the Night, the Dark Lady, Our Lady of 
Loss 

The dark twin of Selune, Shar is the goddess of dark- 
ness, both in its physical form and as it exists in the 
minds and souls of mortals. People worship Shar as 




the goddess of night, secrets, loss, and forgetfulness. 

She represents pains hidden but not forgotten, and ven- 
geances .carefully nurtured away from the light. She is 
said to have the power to make folk forget their pain or 
become inured to a loss, and many people in distress 
pray to Shar for such a blessing. 

Shar is revered by those who must venture into dark 
places and so pray to her for protection, such as miners, 
as well as by those who have fallen into melancholy and 
despair, who wish to forget something, or who have lost 
something and wish to recover it. Priests drawn to serve 
Shar often nurture their own deep wounds or dark se- 
crets, which in their minds makes them best suited to 
console those who suffer from a similar ill. Throughout 
the world’s history, many followers of Shar have done 
dark deeds in her name— most notably the shadovar of 
Netheril, an entire society dedicated to Shar. The trag- 
edies and losses brought about by the fanaticism of her 
followers have caused many places to outlaw her wor- 
ship and thus driven most of her priests into secrecy, but 
such prohibitions only heighten the priests’ umbrage at 
authorities and make the faithful a focal point for rebel- 
lion and revenge against whoever rules. 

SlLVANUS 

Oak Father, the Old Oak, Old Father Tree 

Silvanus represents the entirety of nature, deserts as 
well as forests, sharks as much as deer. But folk in the 
North, who contend with the dangers of forests, moun- 
tains, and plains, see Silvanus more as a god of those 
places. Silvanus is thought of as a grim and severe 
father figure who metes out flood and drought, fire and 
ice, and life and death in the wilderness. In legends he 
often commands other nature deities, dealing out re- 
wards and punishments to them as is fitting. 

Nature and its impartial fairness is central to the 
dogma of Silvanus's faith. His priests seek to know the 
total situation, to view the macrocosm; their viewpoint 
isn't confined to one person’s or one nation’s idea of 
what is best. The loss of a farming community to goblin 
raids is a tragedy for some, but the event provides an 
opportunity for the wilderness to grow up and make 
the land fertile again, which in turn provides new chal- 
lenges for those who would return to tame it. 

The creed of Silvanus dictates that nature’s glory must 
be preserved not merely because nature is beautiful, but 
because wild nature is the true state of the world. Its ex- 
panses refresh and revitalize the mortal soul, and give 



breath to all the world. Many of his faithful oppose the 
expansion of settlements into wild places, and consider 
excessive consumption of natural resources to be not 
only wasteful but blasphemous. 

Silvanus often receives veneration from travelers in 
wild lands, explorers, and residents of rural communi- 
ties far from the protection of a local lord or a great city. 
The oak leaf is Silvanus’s symbol, and a grove of oak 
trees within a village or on its outskirts is often dedi- 
cated as a shrine to him. In rural places where oak trees 
don't grow, an oak leaf etched into the bark of another 
kind of tree signifies a sacred site. 

SUNE 

Lady Fi rehair, the Lady of Love, the Princess of Passion 

Sune Firehair is a deity of passion and the delights 
of the senses. She is the goddess of beauty in all its 
forms— not just pleasing sights, but also enchanting 
sounds, luxurious tastes and scents, and the exquisite 
pleasures of the flesh, from a lover’s caress to the brush 
of silk on the skin. Her worshipers seek out these plea- 
sures in life, not out of mere decadence, but because the 
experience of pleasure is the touch of Sune herself. 

The followers of Sune have a reputation as hedonists, 
and so they are, to a degree. More than that, her priests 
foster beauty in the world. They do so by creating art, by 
acting as patrons for promising talents, and by investing 
in merchants who bring luxuries to far-off places that 
have never seen satin or tasted a luscious wine. 

Her priests consider loveliness to be one of their 
greatest callings, and all are trained in comportment, 
fashion, and cosmetics. Indeed, so talented are Sune’s 
priests in the creation of beautiful appearances that 
many take pride in their ability to present themselves as 
stunningly attractive examples of either gender. 

But beauty is more than skin deep, say the Sunites; it 
issues from the core of one’s being and shows one’s true 
face to the world, whether fair or foul. The followers of 
Sune are believers in romance, true love winning over 
all, and following one’s heart to one’s true destination. 
Fated matches, impossible loves, and ugly ducklings be- 
coming swans are all in the purview of Sune. 

Temples dedicated to Sune are common in human 
lands, and they frequently serve as public baths and 
places of relaxation. A temple usually features a mir- 
rored and well-lit salon where folks can primp, as well 
as see others and be seen. Where a temple doesn't exist, 
or in a large city where the nearest temple might be too 



Symbol of Sune 


CHAPTER 1 | WELCOME TO THE REALMS 






far to walk to, a small shrine to Sune often stands near 
a street corner. These sites consist of a mirror hung 
beneath a small roof where one can say a prayer while 
checking ones appearance. The spot might feature a 
shelf or a cupboard holding various perfumes and cos- 
metics so that those without the funds to purchase such 
items can still make themselves feel beautiful. 

Talona 

Lady of Poison, Mistress of Disease, the Plague-crone 

One of the most often beseeched of Faerun’s deities, 

Talona is the goddess of disease and poison, blamed for 
everything from common illnesses to crop failure to brack- 
ish wells to plague. Depicted in temple iconography as a 
withered crone with a cup or a vase that holds all the vari- 
eties of disease and poison, Talona is a fearsome goddess, 
and many are the prayers that beg her for protection from 
illness and poison. Various rituals to placate her involve the 
use of three drops of blood or three tears— to be dropped 
into a well that has gone bad, dripped into the handkerchief 
of someone beset by coughing, dropped into a fire made 
by burning a withered crop, dripped into the mouth of a 
plague sufferer, and so on. It’s common practice to mark a 
container of poison with her holy symbol, three droplets in 
a triangle, and during epidemics folk paint the same image 
on the homes of the infected. 

Though she is often the recipient of prayers, Talona 
has almost no temples and few cults dedicated to her. A 
cult or a shrine to her might arise in an area after it suf- 
fers from pestilence, when some of those who survived 
decide to revere her or even become priests. 

Talos 

Stormlord, the Destroyer 

Talos is the dark side of nature, the uncaring and de- 
structive force that might strike at any time. He is the 
god of storms, forest fires, earthquakes, tornadoes, and 
general destruction. He counts the ravager, the raider, 
the looter, and the brigand among his followers. Those 
who favor him see life as a succession of random effects 
in a sea of chaos, so the devout should grab what they 
can, when they can— for who can say when Talos will 
strike and send them into the afterlife? 

Talos is portrayed as a broad-shouldered, bearded 
young man with a single good eye, the other covered 
by a dark patch. He is said to carry a collection of three 
staffs, made from the first tree cut down in the world, 


the first silver smelted, and the first iron forged. He uses 
these staffs to raise destructive winds, cause terrible 
storms, and split the land in acts of rage. The three light- 
ning bolts of his holy symbol represent these staffs, and 
when he vents his wrath on the world, he is thought to 
hurl them down from the sky as lightning strikes. 

Although Talos is a popular deity, his name is invoked 
more often out of fear than out of reverence. He does 
have priests, mostly traveling doomsayers, who warn 
of disasters to come and accept charity in exchange for 
blessings of protection. Many of his faithful wear a black 
eyepatch, even if both eyes are intact. 

Tempus 

The Foehammer, the Lord of Battles 

Tempus is a war god concerned with brave conduct 
during war, using force of arms over talk for settling 
disputes, and encouraging bloodshed. The god of war is 
random in his favors, meaning that his chaotic nature fa- 
vors all sides equally. Lord Tempus might be an army’s 
ally one day, and its enemy the next. He might seem to 
manifest before a battle, appearing to one side or the 
other. If he is seen riding a white mare (Veiros), then the 
army will succeed. If he rides a black stallion (Deiros), 
then defeat is certain. Most often he appears to be rid- 
ing with one foot in each mount’s stirrup, signifying the 
unpredictable nature of battle. In such visions, Tempus 
is always a powerfully built warrior dressed for battle in 
the style of those who envision him. 

Tempus’s favor might be randomly distributed, but 
over the centuries his priests have made an effort to 
spread and enforce a common code of warfare — to make 
war a thing of rules, respect for reputations, and pro- 
fessional behavior. This code, called Tempus’s Honor, 
has the purpose of making conflicts brief, decisive, and 
as safe as possible for those not directly involved. The 
rules in the code include the following: arm anyone who 
has need of a weapon; disparage no foe; acquit oneself 
with bravery; train all for battle; and don’t engage in 
feuds. Those who poison wells, taint fields, kill noncom- 
batants, or engage in torture in the name of war are all 
considered sinners. 

Worshipers of Tempus are legion, and his name is 
often on the lips of soldiers. His priests are tacticians, 
often skilled in the art of war. Many of his ordained 
don’t serve in temples, but as battlefield chaplains with 
armies and mercenary companies, encouraging their 
fellow soldiers with both word and blade. Priests of 



Symbol of Talona 



CHAPTER 1 | WELCOME TO THE REALMS 





Tempus teach that war conducted properly is fair in 
that it oppresses all sides equally, and that in any given 
battle, a mortal might be slain or might become a great 
leader among his or her companions. Mortals shouldn’t 
fear war but should see it as a natural force, the storm 
that civilization brings about by its very existence. 

Torm 


The Loyal Fury, the True, the Hand of Righteousness 

Torm is the god of duty and loyalty, revered by those 
who face danger to bring about a greater good. Those 
who favor Torm believe that one’s salvation can be found 
through service, that every failure to perform one’s 
duty diminishes Torm, and that every success adds to 
his luster. Those who take Torm to heart must strive to 
fulfill his commandment to go out into the world and 
be an active force for good, to right wrongs, and to help 
the hopeless. They must strive to maintain peace and 
order while opposing unjust laws. Followers of Torm 
stand ever alert against corruption and are expected to 
strike quickly and hard against any evidence of rot in the 
hearts of mortals. As the sword arm of justice, Torm’s 
faithful are expected to bring quick deaths to betrayers. 
Considering these tenets, it should be no surprise that 
most human paladins have Torm as their patron. 

Most temples dedicated to Torm are fortresses built 
on heights. These structures offer austere quarters for 
residents and visiting knights, drilling grounds, and 
stables. White granite, lion statues, and armored figures 
predominate in the architecture, with the coats of arms 
of fallen heroes decorating the walls of the great halls. 

Torm is seen as the good right hand of Tyr, and a such 
his symbol is a white gauntlet made for the right hand. 

It represents Tyr’s sword hand, but it is also a symbol of 
forbearance. Torm is frequently depicted with his right 
gauntlet extended palm forward, which worshipers call 
the Hand Resolute. It signifies the principle that the 
just and true must pause before acting to judge whether 
their intentions uphold Torm’s ideals. Temples, civic 
structures, and the homes of the faithful are often dec- 
orated with images of the Hand Resolute as a constant 
reminder of this principle. 

Worshipers of Torm come from most walks of life, for 
he welcomes any who seek the best in themselves and 
others, who uphold his tenets of loyalty, responsibility, 
duty, and kindness, or who are willing to sacrifice to 
keep evil from gaining ascendancy in the world. The 
faithful know that all of them will stumble from time 


Symbol of Tempus 



to time while following in Torm’s footsteps, but Torm’s 
priests teach that the shame of a minor fall from grace 
is far less severe than declining to rise oneself up to 
Torm’s standards. 

Tymora 

Lady Luck, Our Smiling Lady 

Tymora is the bright-faced goddess of fortune, the one 
to whom gamblers and game-players pray in Faerun. 

Our Smiling Lady is said to love none so much as those 
who gamble with the utmost skill and daring. Yet she 
is thought to watch over all who take risks to better 
their fortunes. 

The battle cry of the followers of Tymora is “Fortune 
favors the bold.” Someone might say words to Tymora 
before any endeavor in which a little good luck would 
help, but not when an incidence of bad luck might occur. 
(On such occasions folk pray to Beshaba to spare them 
from bad luck; praying to both is thought to anger both 
goddesses.) One common method of divining the future 
is to toss a coin to a stranger (typically a beggar) and ask 
if it’s heads. If it is, the coin is left with the stranger as 
payment for Tymora’s favor. If it’s not, the stranger can 
choose to keep it (and the bad luck) or return it. 

Those who favor Tymora— as distinct from folk who 
invoke her name by mumbling over the dice— tend to be 
daring sorts. Adventurers and gamblers make up much 
of their ranks. They all have the belief that what is good 
about their lives is the result of having both good luck 
and the bravery to seek it out. Tymora has worshipers 
among all sorts of folk: the dashing young noble, the 
risk-taking merchant, the daydreaming field hand, and 
the scheming ne’er-do-well. 

Priests of Tymora and temples devoted to Lady Luck 
are scarce, since her faith tends not to stress a need 
for intermediaries: “Let the lucky man and the Smiling 
Lady suss it out,” as the old saying goes. Shrines to 
Tymora at gambling parlors aren’t unusual, however, 
and sometimes such establishments attract a priest and 
effectively become temples.

The Legend of Tyche and Her Twin 
Daughters 

Before the Dawn Cataclysm, there was but one goddess 
of luck, Tyche. Ever flirting with fortune and disaster, Lady 
Luck bestowed and withdrew her favor at a whim. When 
her current paramour, Lathander, started a fight among the 
gods, Tyche kissed the Morninglord with misfortune and 
wandered off to explore the world. 

During her travels, Lady Luck discovered a budding 
rose of unequaled beauty. Delighted with this fortuitous 
happenstance, Tyche reached to pluck this delightful 
token, which she assumed was a peace overture from 
Lathander, who sought to regain her good graces. Much to 
her amazement, Lady Luck couldn’t pluck the rose from its 
bush no matter how hard she tried. Frustrated, she cursed 
the rose with bad luck, and the flower’s stem broke in her 
hands. Tyche put the plucked rose behind her ear and 
continued on her way. Unknown to Tyche, the rose was a 
manifestation of Moander, god of corruption and decay. 

The severed rose stem crept into Tyche’s ear and subtly 
began to rot her from the inside out. 

When Tyche returned home, she came across her dear 
friend, the goddess Selune, waiting to speak with her. 

Also waiting for her were Lathander, who wished to regain 
her affections, and Azuth, who had come to mediate the 
dispute between the two. Selune wept great tears as she 
saw the corruption destroying her friend from within, and 
before Tyche could discern her intent, Selune lashed out 
with a bolt of purifying light. Tyche’s rotted core split down 
the middle and a smaller, brighter version of the goddess 
of luck stepped out, allowing the goddess of the moon to 
save that which was good and pure in her friend. How- 
ever, following this first figure out of the rotten shell was 
another form stunning to behold, but full of dark malice 
and capricious ill will. As the two forms emerged, they 
immediately fell upon each other in hate, struggling madly, 
and were separated only by the combined efforts of all 
three visitors. 

It is said thatTymora, Tyche’s Fair-Haired Daughter, 
embodies all the grace and kindness of her mother, while 
Beshaba, Tyche’s Unpleasant Daughter, got only her looks. 
Since their birth, the twin aspects of Tyche — Tymora, Lady 
Luck, and Beshaba, Maid of Misfortune — have battled 
each other, contesting matters as great as the fate of 
nations and as small as the flip of a coin.

tice of the Overgod’s actions. 

Tyr’s followers devote themselves to the cause of 
justice, to the righting of wrongs and the deliverance of 
vengeance. This devotion isn’t necessarily concerned 
with equality or fairness, but rather the discovery of 
truth and the punishment of the guilty. Those who favor 
Tyr tend to be stiff-necked about matters of theology 
and laws, seeing things in terms of black and white. 
Tyr’s credo of lawfulness and honesty is a demanding 
one, and his priests remind the faithful not to hold in 
contempt others who can’t live by it— it wouldn’t be an 
honorable calling if everyone could muster the strength 
of will to follow it. 

Many orders of knighthood are devoted to Tyr, includ- 
ing the Knights of Holy Judgment and the Knights of the 
Merciful Sword. Such knights— as well as judges and 
priests, clerics, and paladins who worship Tyr— some- 
times wear thin strips of diaphanous cloth over their 
eyes to remind others of the blindness of justice. 

Umberlee 

The Bitch Queen, the Queen of the Depths, the 
Wavemother 

No community that lives by the sea can ignore the influ- 
ence of Umberlee, the furious goddess whose tempestu- 
ous nature reflects and is reflected by the waters of the 
deep. Any such community makes sure to host festivals 
to propitiate the Wavemother and seek her favor. Al- 
though mercurial in temperament, she can be generous 
to those who do her honor, as is any great queen. 

The Bitch Queen is worshiped out of fear instead of 
adoration, and ship crews offer her gems, tossed over 
the side, to calm storm-tossed waters. As her most com- 
mon moniker suggests, she is viewed as capricious and 
cruel with no firm ethical outlook; the sea is a savage 
place, and those who travel it had best be willing to pay 
the price of challenging her domain. 

There is little in the way of an organized clergy of Um- 
berlee. Her priests roam coastal cities, warning of doom 
and demanding free passage on ships in return for en- 
suring the goddess’s pleasure. Often they wear the col- 
ors of waves and storms, and they decorate themselves 


Grimjaws, the Maimed God, the Evenhanded 



Tyr Grimjaws, Tyr the Evenhanded, Wounded Tyr, the 
Maimed God, the Blind, Blind Tyr, the Lord of Justice- 
all of these names speak to the nature of the Faerunian 
god of justice. Tyr appears as a noble warrior missing 
his right hand, which he lost to Kezef the Chaos Hound 
in an act of bravery and sacrifice, and with his eyes 
wrapped in cloth to signify his blindness, caused by a

The Gods of Mulhorand 

People of Faerun refer to Mulhorand as one of the Old 
Empires, but most don’t know that Mulhorand is in 
fact the oldest human empire still in existence on the 
continent. Mulhorand’s pantheon of deities, sometimes 
called god-kings or pharaohs, can trace their lineage even 
farther back. 

According to the demigods enthroned in Mulhorand, the 
ancestors of the Mulhorandi people were brought from 
another world and enslaved by the Imaskari in an ancient 
empire deep in what is now Raurin, the Dust Desert. When 
the gods of those ancestors heard the pleas of their distant 
faithful, they set out in a great celestial ark guided by the 
entity known as Ptah. Upon arriving in the world, two of 
the deities, Re and Enlil, set about empowering the slaves 
and fomenting rebellion. 

The revolt succeeded, but Re and Enlil couldn’t keep 
peace with one another. Each then founded a separate 
dynasty of divine mortals, Re in Mulhorand, and Enlil 
(father of Gilgeam) in Unther. Re and his related deities 
ruled Mulhorand through mortal incarnations for thou- 
sands of years. 

Time took its toll, and the attention the deities of Mul- 
horand paid to their followers wavered and diminished. 
Each new incarnation of Isis, Osiris, and Thoth was a little 
more human and a little less divine. When the magically 
powerful Imaskari returned with a vengeance a little over 
a century ago, they stole the scepter of rulership from a 
grasp so weak it barely had any strength left. 

Although Mulhorand’s conquerors outlawed slavery in 
the area they now called High Imaskar, the Mulhorandi 
people recognized the yoke they now bore. The Imaskari 
were the new coming of the slavemasters of old, as depict- 
ed in the carvings in the pharaohs’ tombs. Many prayed 
that the vanished gods would return and once again free 
them from Imaskari rule, and during the Sundering, that is 
what happened. What were referred to as Chosen in other 
lands were recognized in Mulhorand as living gods, come 
to lead the Mulhorandi in an uprising. 

Today Mulhorand is ruled by demigods that call them- 
selves by such names as Re, Anhur, Horus, Isis, Nephthys, 
Set, and Thoth. They take different forms, some human 
and others tieflings or aasimar, but all speak and act 
like the gods of legend come to life, which they must be. 
This family of deities bears the scars of all the past loves, 
rivalries, and wars between them, but for now they have 
set their differences aside for the betterment of Mul- 
horand and its people, and the people of Mulhorand love 
them for it. 


with items that remind others of the sea’s dangerous 
nature— a necklace of shark teeth, seaweed wrapped 
about a human bone, and so on. The preserved hand of 
a drowned person is thought to be a particularly holy ob- 
ject, and some of her few clerics use such severed hands 
as holy symbols. Umberlee does have a large number of 
shrines in the coastal cities, and sailors often leave flow- 
ers or small candies at them in hopes that she will spare 
them on their next voyage. Both Waterdeep and Baldur’s 
Gate have true temples dedicated to Umberlee, staffed 
largely by the widows of sailors lost at sea. 


Waukeen 

Our Lady of Gold, the Coinmaiden , the Merchant's 
Friend 


Symbol of Waukeen 


Waukeen is the goddess of wealth and trade, on both 
sides of the law. Her most ardent worshipers include 
shopkeepers, members of trading costers, wealthy 
merchants, caravan guides, itinerant peddlers, money- 
changers, and smugglers. She is interested in anything 
that increases trade and the flow of money, whether new 
trade routes, new inventions, or the whim of changing 
fashion. Those who take Waukeen as a patron can be re- 
liably thought of as greedy, but the Coinmaiden is said to 
frown upon misers and smile upon the industrious and 
the profligate, and thus priests who bear her holy sym- 
bol find themselves welcome in many towns and cities. 

Temples of Waukeen resemble guildhalls and often 
serve as meeting places for trade consortiums. Those 
who follow Waukeen’s ethos seek to create more op- 
portunity for all and see competition for wealth as one 
of society’s main means of progress. Thus, the faithful 
of Our Lady of Gold often find themselves at odds with 
trade guilds and others who would form monopolies. It’s 
common practice among those who seek Waukeen’s fa- 
vor to set aside a tithe of ten percent of their profits, but 
rather than being given to a temple, the money is meant 
to be spent to help a struggling business, to finance a 
new endeavor, or, if all else fails, on frivolous fun.

Chapter 2: The Sword 

HIS CHAPTER DETAILS MANY OF THE 

locales of the Sword Coast and the North, 
gf 1 as seen through the eyes and recollections 

■ ^ of a person living in Faerun. Rather than 

mT n J being exhaustive descriptions, what 

follows are snippets of information drawn 
1 from the experience of five individuals 
who have traversed, lived in, and explored these areas. 
Like any other narrators, they have opinions and biases, 
and may be drawing conclusions from incomplete 
information. No one in the Realms knows everything 
about any subject, even its oldest and most learned 
sages, and the views formed from such incomplete 
information can often suggest an inaccurate conclusion. 
This is not to say that any of the information the 
narrators provide is false, only that they may not be 
entirely knowledgeable in their declarations. 

The details given here only begin to scratch the 
surface of the adventuring possibilities in the North. 
Although some of these locales are virtually unknown 
to outsiders, entire books longer than this one could be 
(and have been) written about others. If the descriptions 
leave you wanting to know more, consider them an 
inducement for you and your companions to visit these 
places and experience them firsthand. 

Be aware, also, that there is a great deal more to the 
North than what is presented here. There are ruins 
without names, and settlements so small as to not 
even warrant mention in this tome. What lurks in the 
uncharted areas, waiting to tantalize or perhaps ter- 
rorize, is all the more formidable because it can’t be 
anticipated. 

The Lords’ Alliance 

For a century and a half, and more, the Lords’ 
Alliance has stood as the most important and influential 
group in the North. Its power has kept towns safe from the 
predations of larger powers, has kept the ambitions ofLus- 
kan in check, and has taught the rulers of many cities that 
it is better to cooperate, even for a time, then to merely shut 
ones doors and allow the storms to rage outside. It was this 
philosophy that led to the founding of Luruar, and when the 
lesson was lost, so too were the Silver Marches. But it serves 
no purpose to dwell on the folly of the past. Better instead 
to look to the future, repair the walls, and wait for word 
from the watching sentries. 

— Andwe Cururen, agent of the Lords’ Alliance 

The Lords’ Alliance isn’t a nation unto itself, but a 
partnership of the rulers of towns and cities across 
the North, who have pledged peace with one another 
and promised to share information and effort against 
common threats such as ore hordes and Northlander 
pirates. It is a loose confederation of those settlements 


Coast and the North 

and their agents, all of whom owe allegiance first to 
their homelands, and second to the Lords’ Alliance. 

In the harsh lands of the North, where winters are 
cold and monsters and human barbarians regularly 
stream out of the mountains to pillage outlying settle- 
ments, large nations are rare indeed, particularly in the 
current state of the world. Instead, great city-states have 
emerged, enriched by trade and protected by stout walls 
and loyal defenders. Such cities— including Baldur's 
Gate, Mirabar, Neverwinter, Silverymoon, and Water- 
deep— extend their influence into nearby regions, often 
creating or accepting vassal settlements, but in the end, 
these realms are cities, driven to consider their own pro- 
tection and future before other concerns. 

In the years soon after its founding more than one 
hundred fifty years ago, there was more interest in mem- 
bership, and the Alliance accepted some members from 
farther south. Since then, events such as the growth of 
Elturgard into a power in its own right, and the recent 
fall of the Silver Marches, have caused the group to 
draw in on itself, restricting its membership to powers 
in the North. The current members of the Alliance are 
Amphail, Baldur’s Gate, Daggerford, Longsaddle, Mira- 
bar, Mithral Hall, Neverwinter, Silverymoon, Waterdeep, 
and Yartar. There is some doubt that Mithral Hall will 
be part of the alliance for much longer, but until ruler- 
ship of the dwarven city is more firmly established, it 
remains a member. 

It is impossible to ascribe an overall character to 
the individual members of the alliance. As a group, 
the agents of the members are interested in the pres- 
ervation of civilization in the North, and they share 
what information they can— and oppose what threats 
they must— to further that goal. In the end, though, a 
merchant of Waterdeep and one of Baldur’s Gate are 
concerned mainly for their own purses and the welfare 
of their home cities, and are unlikely to care what hap- 
pens to the other, except inasmuch as it affects trade. 

The advice and insights in this section come from 
Andwe Cururen, a half-elf native of Silverymoon who 
was once a Knight in Silver (a member of the city’s 
army), and now serves as an emissary and, when neces- 
sary, an active agent for the Lords’ Alliance. She travels 
the North on behalf of the Alliance, representing its 
interests and gathering and updating information on its 
settlements for her superiors, fellow agents, and poten- 
tial recruits, including adventurers who might serve the 
Alliance or one of its members. 

Amphail 

Named for its founder, a former warlord of Waterdeep, 
the small town of Amphail is home to just over seven 
hundred souls, yet it sought and received membership 
in the Lords’ Alliance just under a century ago, thanks 
to the maneuverings of the noble families that control 
its lands. Where once it was simply an example of 
the extent of Waterdeep’s reach, Amphail became the 
playground of that city’s noble families, a place where 
they can scheme against their rivals and send their

Note to the DM: Making the Realms Yours 

The information in this chapter is intentionally nonspecific 
with respect to threats, monsters, and statistics. While 
you can use these details to flavor your descriptions of the 
towns and cities your players might visit, you should in no 
way consider these pieces of narration definitive. They’re 
meant to provide touchstones, not to constrain your play- 
ers to a narrow conception of the world. 

You might decide to change some of the details, either 
to surprise your players or to account for events that have

You’re encouraged to take what’s presented here and make

more rambunctious offspring to unleash some of their 
destructive tendencies without harming the family's rep- 
utation in proper society. As a result of being a member 
of the Lords’ Alliance, Amphail is the equal of such 
great cities as Neverwinter and Baldur’s Gate in matters 
that concern the other powers of the region, despite its 
clear inferiority in size and strength. 

Amphail’s sovereignty means that, although patrols 
from the Waterdeep City Guard sometimes ride north to 
check on matters in Amphail, the only true authority in 
the town is the will of the noble families that control it. 
The primary business of Amphail is horse ranching, and 
the town is a fine place to find replacement mounts, and 
all manner of tack, bridle, feed, and other goods neces- 
sary to keep up one’s horse. Most farms have farriers, or 
at least hands that can swiftly shoe a horse, and spare 
shoes all but litter the town. 

Visitors to Amphail often get a polite admonishment 
to “mind the high born” or “ware silver saddles” from 
the locals, but those who ignore such warnings should 
expect no help if they get into trouble with the nobility. 
Amphailans are by their nature suspicious of and quiet 
around folk who openly display wealth or status, having 
learned early in their lives that nobles are folk who 
like to throw their weight around, to the detriment of 
anyone nearby without enough coin or a grand enough 
title to stand up to them. I find that these common folk 
are ideal sources of information about the very people 
they distrust. 

For their part, the young nobles that litter the town 
seem to make mischief mainly because they can. The 
feuds and rivalries that would generate only carefully 
worded insults in the city can escalate into brawls 
when these miscreants are far from the watchful eyes 
of their parents. Duels have long been prohibited by 
mutual agreement, due to the blood feuds they pro- 
voked in the past, but hands often drift to sword hilts 
when heated words are exchanged. Nearly every other 
sort of noble indiscretion is foisted on the residents of 
Amphail. Those who suffer property damage or worse 
at the nobles’ hands are forced to forgive the offense 
in exchange for the application of coin or a promise 
made in the transgressor's name (suggesting that the 
youngster’s relatives will handle any obligations). Some 
businesses survive entirely by bringing the comforts of 
Waterdeep to Amphail, creating gathering places where 
young nobles can feel at home. 

The three greatest families with significant inter- 
ests in Amphail are Houses Amcathra, Ilzimmer, and 


Roaringhorn; and most coin and business eventually 
passes through the hands one of those houses or its 
intermediaries. When Amphail joined the Lords’ Alli- 
ance, these three houses were the loudest and most 
influential voices, and now control the rulership of 
the town, with the controlling family changing each 
Shieldmeet. The current Lord Warder is Dauner Ilzim- 
mer, who speaks for the town to the Lords’ Alliance. 
House Amcathra has yet to choose its successor for 
next Shieldmeet. Houses Jhansczil and Tarm have 
smaller breeding concerns in the area, and House 
Eagleshields has holdings near Amphail that it uses to 
continue its long tradition of caring for unhealthy ani- 
mals from nearby farms, and offers fine tack and other 
gear for sale. 

Among the common folk, the Oglyntyr family has the 
largest and oldest cattle and horse farm in Amphail, 
and supplies some of the finest Amphail grays (loyal, 
intelligent steeds favored as personal mounts) to nobles 
and travelers in the region. A new family, not noble 
but possessing much wealth, has purchased the old 
Baldasker ranch. We suspect that the Hemzar family, 
who were unknown in either Amphail or Waterdeep 
before the purchase, like most of the mysterious matters 
in Amphail, may have the secret backing of one noble 
house or another. 

My contacts say the Oglyntyrs have petitioned the 
Ilzimmers to help crush this upstart business, a move 
that they are considering. I visited the Hemzar ranch, 
and I’d consider such a move inadvisable. A large family 
of Tashlutar descent, they seemed capable and confident 
of their position, despite my warning. I wasn't allowed 
the opportunity to explore the property fully, but I 
did note signs that the Hemzars are prepared to rear 
and train far more dangerous beasts than horses and 
cattle. I was then tempted to warn the Oglyntyrs, but 
that family can be as odious as the worst nobles. These 
things tend to sort themselves out. 

The noble families of Waterdeep who send their chil- 
dren to Amphail, or allow them to go there, hope that 
their sons and daughters will learn some lessons about 
life while away from Waterdeep. If they are going to 
cause damage or hurt feelings in the process, at least 
they will do so far away from the watchful eyes of the 
other nobility of the city. To the young nobles, there is 
no one in Amphail of any real consequence who might 
be permanently harmed by any improprieties. They also 
believe there is no one of note nearby to hear these hot- 
headed youngsters issue their boasts and proclaim their 
schemes— I have more than once learned of a threat 
simply by listening to children of different houses brag 
to one another about matters that were meant only for 
the family. 

Aside from the excesses of its nobles, Amphail is a 
peaceful town, with the threat of full-scale retaliation 
from both Waterdeep and the Lords' Alliance casting 
a long, dark shadow over any plans to disturb matters 
there. The nobles of Waterdeep have heavy purses, 
and are willing to spend as much coin as necessary 
to protect their favored playground— and to punish 
anyone that might disrupt their control over it. The 
only thing the nobles don’t seem to be able to spend 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH

away is the smell of manure, which in the summer 
months hangs thick over the town. It is that manure 
that helps to feed the true business of Amphail: feeding 
Waterdeep with the produce from the many farms that 
surround the town. 

Because so many of Amphail’s farms are owned by 
House Ammakyl, members of that noble family are by 
far the most enriched by the commerce there. They 
consider themselves good landlords to the folk that farm 
their lands, and are sure to bring any threats to honest, 
hard-working commoners to the attention of both the 
Lord Warder and the Lords of Waterdeep. Anything 
that threatens farming in Amphail threatens the City of 
Splendors directly, and such situations are dealt with 
swiftly and surely by the city’s Guard. As a result, even 
the most rebellious nobles are careful not to tread too 
heavily on Ammakyl turf in Amphail, as a house that 
does so might swiftly find its favorite foods suddenly 
difficult to procure for a revel or some other event where 
the family’s status is at risk. 

Baldur’s Gate 

On the Coast Way, some forty miles upstream along the 
River Chionthar from the Sword Coast, lies the bustling 
city of Baldur’s Gate. Home to tens of thousands, the 
harbor city has poor soil, but its sheltered bay, well away 
from the tides that batter the coast, make it an ideal 
location for trading goods from locations to the west in 
the Sea of Swords, inland along the river, and up and 
down the coast. Baldur’s Gate is a place of commerce, 
and the city enjoys great success handling the coins of 
other powers and making them its own. 

Sadly, Baldur’s Gate has a storied connection with 
the dark god, Bhaal. Just a few years ago, the city saw 
the terrifying return of the Lord of Murder. Following 
a number of deaths, one of the city’s dukes, Torlin 
Silvershield, was revealed as the Chosen of Bhaal, 
and underwent a monstrous transformation, turning 
many citizens into bloodthirsty killers and inspiring a 
riot and much death before finally being put down by 
brave adventurers. Even now, murderous echoes ripple 
through the city and beyond, and reports of unexplain- 
able, gruesome killings flow out of Baldur’s Gate. 

Baldur’s Gate is ruled by the Council of Four, dukes 
who vote among themselves on matters of law and 
policy for the city. A single grand duke is chosen from 
among the four, and is empowered to break ties when 
the council is deadlocked. The current Grand Duke is 
Ulder Ravengard, who is joined by Dukes Thalamra 
Vanthampur, Belynne Stelmane, and Dillard Portyr, the 
former grand duke, who ceded the post to Ravengard 
after the city’s recent troubles. Below the council sits the 
Parliament of Peers, a group of about fifty Baldurians 
who meet daily (though almost never in full number) to 
discuss the future of the city and recommend actions for 
the dukes to take on all matters, great and small. At any 
given time, roughly one-quarter of the peers are power- 
ful members of Lower City society, with the rest drawn 
from the Upper City’s noble families, called patriars. 

Defense of the Upper City is handled by the Watch, 
the official constabulary of the city’s elite. Their duty is 
to defend the patriars and enforce their laws, and little

else. For the rest of Baldur’s Gate, security is enforced 
and order maintained by the Flaming F'ist mercenary 
company, a supposedly neutral force which is free to 
fight in external conflicts, so long as it doesn’t side 
against Baldur’s Gate. By tradition, the highest officer 
of the Flaming Fist is one of the city’s dukes, and Grand 
Duke Ulder Ravengard fulfills that tradition proudly. 
Membership in the Flaming Fist is fairly easy to achieve, 
and adventurers with much experience swiftly advance 
in rank (and, consequently, political influence) once they 
become permanent members. Many ranking officers are 
former adventurers who have “retired" to military life. 

In both the Upper and Lower Cities, the underworld 
is controlled by a shadowy group known merely as the 
Guild. The dukes don’t acknowledge the power of this 
group in any meaningful way— at least not publicly— but 
try (at least nominally) to curb its influence where and 
how they can. I lost count of how many gangs claim ter- 
ritory in the Lower and Outer City, and all of them seem 
to owe allegiance to the Guild. Efforts to destroy the 
Guild have thus far failed, due in part to the inability of 
outsiders to identify a clear leader of the group, but in no 
small measure to the shameful lack of effort on the part 
of the rulers of the city to protect its people. 


Upper City 

The Upper City of Baldur’s Gate is the enclosed haven 
of the city’s nobility— the patriars. Sitting atop their hill, 
the patriars look down on the rest of Baldur’s Gate in 
every real sense, wielding their wealth and influence 
to push the Council of Four to protect their lifestyle. 

Though at one time a wealthy merchant or powerful 
adventurer might hope to advance to the ranks of the 
patriars, there is no longer room, physically or other- 
wise, for the class of the Upper City to grow. Now, only 
those born into the patriar families inhabit the manors 
of this oldest part of Baldur’s Gate. The poorest among 
these go so far as to sell furnishings and decorations 
from inside their homes in order to keep up appear- 
ances with their fellow patriars. 

Most would say that the lives of patriars are marked 
by luxury and decadence, and for a great many of them, 
this is likely true. However, some families do make an 
honest attempt at improving the city, and nearly every 
family has at least one member who engages in major 

CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 

■■■■ — ■■ ■ l ■■ mmmrntmm — T 45 



commerce— no matter ones heritage, everyone must 
have coin in order to eat. There is but one nonhuman 
family among the patriars, the dwarven Shattershields, 
who have been in Baldurs Gate for long enough that 
they are just as accomplished as their human peers at 
looking down on the rest of the citizenry. 

A number of gates divide the Upper City from the 
Lower City, but the one to note is the famous Baldurs 
Gate, from which the city takes its name. Trade passes 
only through this gate, and is taxed by the city— despite 
the fact that it was just such taxes that led to the city’s 
being overthrown by its first dukes and the Lower City 
enclosed by its ring wall. The other gates exist solely for 
the convenience of the patriars and their retinues. Any 
who aren’t in the presence of a patriar, wearing a patri- 
ar’s livery, or bearing a letter of proof of employment by 
a patriar must use Baldurs Gate to pass between the 
Upper and Lower Cities. Bear this in mind when trying 
to sneak from one part of the city to the next. 

Lower City 

Hard against the harbor lies the Lower City, where 
stone, slate-roofed houses stand (sometimes unsteadily), 
and the folk who have long performed the real work of 
the city reside. Baldurs Gate depends on trade, and that 
trade flows in and out of the Gray Harbor. The hands 
that load and unload ships, that tally cargo and haul 
goods, that repair keels and mend sails, all live here. 

The damp clings heavily in this portion of the city- 
some say it’s held in by the Old Wall— and lamps (lit and 


filled by citizens, not the city) pierce the fog. Most locals 
are wise enough to carry lanterns or lamps, and visitors 
that have not learned to do so can usually hire a young 
Baldurian to guide them through the streets. 

The Lower City was long ago walled in to benefit from 
the protection of the city, but the divide between the two 
wards is as stark as it has ever been. The Flaming Fist 
is responsible for keeping order in the Lower City, and 
do so with brutal efficiency, deterring most from engag- 
ing in bold, public acts of theft, vandalism, or violence. 

Where merchants in other cities might hope to one 
day join the nobility, in Baldurs Gate the best one can 
hope for is to become an absurdly wealthy and influen- 
tial merchant. Becoming a patriar is out of the question. 
Still, the wealthiest Baldurians live as much like the 
patriars as they can, buying up adjacent properties in 
the hopes of demolishing them in order to build large 
homes to echo the manors of the Upper City. The 
Bloomridge district has a number of such homes, and 
some of the patriars grumble that these merchants are 
growing too comfortable with their new status. 

Outer City 

Outside the walls, there are no laws barring construc- 
tion or settlement, and so those who are too poor to 
reside within the city or to purchase property have 
slowly built up a third ward of the city, living in the 
shadow of its walls, paying its taxes, and covering both 
sides of the roads leading into Baldurs Gate. Here, the 
poorest of the poor live in the Outer City, but so too do 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 







those whose businesses are considered too trouble- 
some, noisy, or foul-smelling to operate within the walls, 
so tanners, smiths, masons, dyers, and other tradesfolk 
abound. The city does woefully little to help the folk 
here, and charitable souls (myself included) sometimes 
start at one end of the road with a full purse, only to see 
it empty by the time they reach the other end. 

The lack of laws in the Outer City has led to two 
strange phenomena, unrelated to one another. A walled 
Calishite district has grown up to the east of the city 
proper, known by Baldurians as Little Calimshan. 
Within the district, neighborhoods are divided by walls, 
but these walls have walkways atop them so that foot 
traffic can proceed unimpeded by the gates that slow 
carts and mounts. Here, refugees from Calimshan 
have found a home away from that southern nation, 
and largely depend on themselves for trade, culture, 
and defense. 

Buildings have also been constructed along Wyrm’s 
Crossing over the Chionthar. Shops, taverns, and tene- 
ments choke the bridge, hanging from both spans, and 
even in some cases built to hang from the supports that 
hold it up. Folk must pay a toll to cross on foot or by cart 
or wagon, but many swear they would pay yet more to be 
able to use the bridge without having to dodge the hawk- 
ers and urchins that infest the area. 

Daggerford 

Built against the side of a low hill on the floodplains of 
the Delimbiyr, this small, walled town is dominated by 
the keep of the local duchess, Lady Morwen Dagger- 
ford. Counting the town itself and the nearby hamlets 
and farms that look to it for protection and guidance, 
some twelve hundred people call the area home. Lady 
Morwen is the sister of the previous duke, Maldwyn 
Daggerford, and she seems a capable and charismatic 
leader. The Daggerford family's authority over the area 
dates back to the ancient Kingdom of Man that suc- 
ceeded Phalorm in the region. Though that realm has 
been dust for centuries, there are those that see Dagger- 
ford as the last bastion of a better time of peace, wealth, 
and influence— a time that, given the right leadership, 
has the smallest of chances of being restored. 

Daggerford is a pastoral haven. Wide, sprawling hills 
nearby offer peaceful vistas, but are sometimes overrun 
by raiding ores or goblins. The frequent caravans head- 
ing north to Waterdeep or south to Baldur’s Gate need 
escort or guarding, and can offer news of both of those 
cities (and the settlements between them). Several inns 
stand ready to accept visitors, except in the busiest of 
trade or festival periods, when they fill swiftly, and many 
locals open up their homes to lodgers. Warriors in need 
of coin can help their purses by offering their services as 
trainers for the local militia, or accompanying the town 
guard on its patrols. 

Daily rulership is in the hands of the Council of 
Guilds, composed of the heads of the town’s informal 
trade groups. These guildmasters believe themselves 
more powerful and influential than they truly are, 
imitating the Lords of Waterdeep by going robed and 
masked to council meetings. This charade, in the eyes 
of most, borders on farce, as everyone in Daggerford 


knows precisely who the council members are, and no 
magic disguises the forms, voices, or mannerisms of the 
guild leaders, and a trained spy can learn which guild- 
master is which after only an evening or two of proper 
observation. 

The largest and oldest building in Daggerford is the 
ducal castle, a three-level keep enclosed by a two-story 
wall that contains its own smithy, a wide parade ground, 
and stabling for a large number of animals. The dukes of 
Daggerford have always kept a well-stocked larder, capa- 
ble of feeding the castle’s inhabitants and any citizens 
that might shelter inside during a siege. 

Three gates lead into the town of Daggerford: River 
Gate, which provides access to the river, and through 
which shipping cargo is carted into the town proper; 
Caravan Gate, which handles most landgoing traffic, 
including land-based trade; and Farmers’ Gate, which 
remains open at nearly all times, but is wide enough 
only to let one wagon or cart pass at a time. 

A militia guards Daggerford. Militia service is manda- 
tory for all able-bodied adults, and lasts for twenty years. 
All citizens living within the town receive instruction 
from the duchess’s own soldiers in the use of spears and 
other weapons, and must spend at least one day a month 
in defense of the town, standing sentry on its walls or 
patrolling the nearby roads. Their training means that 
the common citizens of Daggerford aren’t easily cowed 
by armed folk demanding goods, coin, or passage, and 
are slightly more likely to take up work as mercenaries, 
caravan guards, or adventurers. 

Although she is less amiable than her brother was, 
Lady Morwen is acknowledged as more capable of 
ruling Daggerford than Duke Maldwyn had been. She 
is well liked by the people, who understand that she has 
an honorable heart, and wishes what is best for Dagger- 
ford. She regularly trains with the militia, and is seen in 
the town wearing armor just as often as she is adorned 
in the finery befitting her station. She often visits the 
local shrine to Tempus, which only enhances her rep- 
utation as a pious woman. Lady Morwen’s features are 
only now starting to age, as though catching up with her 
white hair. 

Most folk of Daggerford know one another, at least 
casually, by sight. Strangers are usually welcome, 
especially if they have coin to spend, unless such folk 
come armed and belligerent through the town. Guards 
stationed at each gate make note of new faces, but don’t 
take action against those they don’t recognize unless 
they are given reason to do so. 

The largest of the town’s inns, the River Shining 
Tavern, is the second biggest building in Daggerford, 
and the site of many local celebrations and gatherings. 
Here, the wealthy come to eat and relax. The inn is 
old— many locals claim it to be older even than the ducal 
castle— and to many, is the very soul of Daggerford. The 
Silver Flood Inn and Lizard’s Gizzard also offer rooms, 
though the latter has no food to provide its guests, 
only beds. 

One of Daggerford’s most unusual businesses is the 
Sword Coast Traders’ Bank, which accepts deposits 
from traveling merchants and enables them to receive 
these funds at a similar location in either Waterdeep 




CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 

J i — WMW 


Ruined Kingdoms of the North 

Many folk consider the start of civilization in the North to 
be marked by the founding of Waterdeep. More learned 
folk are aware of the deeper history of the region, and 
know of at least some of the kingdoms that have been 
built by the residents of the North down the centuries. 

Ruins of these kingdoms are scattered throughout the 
North, and many present-day cities and towns are built 
atop their remains, sometimes with their residents igno- 
rant of what lies just beneath their boots. 

Eaerlann. The elven kingdom of Eaerlann, a survivor of 
the ancient Crown Wars, stretched from the High Forest to 
the Delimbiyr Vale. Weakened by the retreat of much of its 
populace to Evermeet and by ore attacks, Eaerlann finally 
fell six hundred years ago to the demons that burst forth 
from Ascalhorn (once known as Hellgate Keep and now as 
Hellgate Dell). 

Illefarn. Ten thousand years ago, the capital city of llle- 
farn occupied the site where Waterdeep stands today. A 
kingdom of elves that accepted both humans and dwarves 
in its lands, Illefarn stood intact for seven millennia. It was 
eventually fragmented by increasing human settlement of 
the area, and repeated ore attacks spelled its doom. 

Athalantar. The short-lived human kingdom ofAthalan- 
tar lay south of the High Forest in territory claimed by 
its self-styled Stag King thirteen centuries ago. Its rulers 
were briefly supplanted by magelords, but then reclaimed 
the throne, only to be wiped out by ores within a few 
generations. 

Phalorm. Dwarf, elf, and human monarchs all shared 
the rule of Phalorm, also known as the Realm of Three 
Crowns, which was founded nearly a thousand years ago 
in the High Moor. Phalorm lasted barely a century before 
repeated ore and goblin attacks overcame it. 

Kingdom of Man. When Phalorm fell, the surviving hu- 
mans of the kingdom established the Kingdom of Man, 
formally known as Delimbiyran, which lasted only two 
generations. Its dissolution left behind a number of petty 
“kingdoms” that welcomed new human settlers in several 
locations, leading to the founding of new cities and towns 
on the Sword Coast and in its environs. 

Netheril. For centuries, the legend of Netheril served 
as a lesson of human hubris and a lure for treasure hunt- 
ers too prideful to learn from its story. Long before the 
Dales Compact and the advent of Dalereckoning, Netheril 
arose as a human empire founded on the might of magic 
learned from the golden Nether Scrolls, artifacts at least 
as old as the creator races. Flying Netherese cities drifted 
through the skies all over the North, but primarily they 
hung high over a verdant land that is now the desert 
of Anauroch. 

Then Karsus, one of the mighty mages of Netheril, dared 
to believe that he could wrest control of the Weave and 
become a god himself. He almost succeeded, but in his 
failure Karsus killed the goddess of magic, shredded the 
Weave, and sent the floating enclaves that couldn’t flee to 
other planes crashing to the ground. From the moments 
after the crash when the spilt blood was still fresh to the 
present day’s moss-covered or dune-buried stones, the ru- 
ins of Netheril and its arcane secrets have drawn many to 
their doom. 


or Baldur’s Gate. Lady Belinda Anteos (of the Water- 
deep noble house) promises that her business is secure 
and that the banks magical means of communicating 
precise amounts of currency between cities can’t be 
tampered with. 


Members of local guilds that do business outside the 
town don’t entirely trust the Traders’ Bank, preferring 
instead to borrow coin from the Hardcheese family of 
halflings that run the Happy Cow tavern. The Alliance 
officially has no preference, but I find Lady Anteos trust- 
worthy enough to be an alternative to carrying large 
sums on the road. It's easier to part with a small portion 
of one’s purse than to lose everything to a band of brig- 
ands during a journey through the wilds. 

Visitors to Daggerford are advised both to avoid the 
tannery to the west and to swiftly cross Tyndal’s Bridge 
when approaching from the south. The tannery’s loca- 
tion, up on the hill, does little to contain the stink of the 
process, and the Watermen’s Guild dumps the city's 
waste over the side of the bridge. On hot days, the scents 
exuded from both sites can be overwhelming, which is 
why I have again asked the Alliance to assign a different 
agent to visit on next summer's rounds. 

Tyndal's Bridge is a low stone structure over which 
travelers pass when approaching from the west, where 
a local boy named Tyndal held off a number of lizard- 
folk with only a dagger. He grew to manhood, married 
the local ruler's daughter, named himself duke, and 
built Daggerford atop the ruins of an older castle. This 
story, and most of the area’s history, is happily related 
to any who ask by Sir Darfin Floshin, an elf older than 
Daggerford itself. He longs to see a rise in cooperation 
between humans, dwarves, and elves in the region, such 
as was once embodied in the realm of Phalorm. Darfin 
has been advisor to many dukes of Daggerford through 
the years. Though he was rebuffed by Duke Maldwyn 
during his reign, there are signs that Lady Morwen may 
be more receptive to the advice of a gold elf who has wit- 
nessed the fall of the human kingdom of Delimbiyran, 
the founding of Daggerford, and all the days since. 

Longsaddle 

The hamlet of Longsaddle is little more than a row of 
buildings on either side of the Long Road, halfway along 
the lengthy journey from Triboar to Mirabar. A path 
leaves the road here and winds to the Ivy Mansion, the 
great house of the wizards of the Harpell family. Since 
the Harpells founded the town more than four centuries 
ago, they have brooked little nonsense and less mayhem. 
Their own behavior sometimes borders on the bizarre 
and can be disturbing— they once turned two rival sects 
of Malarites into rabbits for disturbing Longsaddle with 
their squabbles, leaving them at the mercy of the pred- 
ators they had honored— but they are one of the most 
potent gatherings of mages anywhere in the North. 

The Harpells are a jovial, if insular, lot. All wizards, 
they tend to marry wizards as well, and the elder women 
of the family (by blood or marriage) set the course 
for the house and utterly rule matters within the Ivy 
Mansion. The family takes on a number of apprentice 
wizards, using them for menial tasks and for basic 
defense of Longsaddle. Some apprentices are often the 
inadvertent test subjects for an experimental spell, but 
such is the danger of apprenticing to the Harpells. It 
is likely this spirit of experimentation that caused the 
Harpells to found their town so far away from other 
settlements. Young wizards with oddly sized or shaped 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 


limbs, strange hair color, or shifting forms are fairly 
common sights in Longsaddle, not surprising to locals 
though they might give visitors pause. 

Given the Harpells’ reputation as powerful wizards, 
and the sheer number of them, there is no shortage of 
folk poking around Longsaddle and the nearby lands 
hoping to discover caches of magic, hidden like chil- 
dren’s treasures. Of course, few, if any, such bundles 
exist, but the locals draw no shortage of entertainment 
from sending would-be thieves on grand chases for 
wands, rings, and other magic trinkets that any prudent 
person would realize simply don’t exist. After all, if the 
average trader in Longsaddle knew where powerful 
magic was located, he would be more likely, down the 
years, to try to claim it. 

The primary business of Longsaddle is ranching, and 
the lands surrounding the village are dominated by hun- 
dreds of ranches and farms of every sort and size, from 
tiny horse farms to great fields of cattle. During those 
days that livestock are brought in for trading, Longsad- 
dle is a dusty, noise-filled place, with the sounds of the 
animals competing with the shouts of farmers hoping to 
sell their goods. 

At all other times, it’s a quiet, almost sleepy hamlet, 
except when the booming reverberation of a Har- 
pell-crafted spell breaks the silence. The family is 
constantly researching magic both old and new, and 
twisting spells and rituals into interesting (to them) 
innovations. This proclivity has prompted them to sur- 
round Ivy Mansion with as many magical wards as the 
family can muster, in order to protect the populace from 
an errant explosion, terrifying illusion, or the odd, gal- 
loping horse of lightning speeding by. 

Several businesses designed to attract travelers stand 
in Longsaddle, if for no other reason than travel along 
the well-named Long Road can be tiresome. The first 
is the Gilded Horseshoe, an old inn to the west of the 
road that serves fine food and drink, offers comfortable 
beds, and is close enough to the Ivy Mansion that no 
one would dare disturb it or its guests. The owners have 
access to some of the choicest cuts of meat in Longsad- 
dle, and as a result, their roasts and stews are exquisite. 

Across the road, the Ostever family serves as the local 
slaughterer and butcher for folk wishing to take meat, 
rather than live animals, away from Longsaddle. Rumor 
holds that the sausages have much improved down the 
years but buyers are advised to “mind the tusks” by 
locals, a reference to an old joke that none remember. 
Folk willing to wait can have the able hands of the 
Ostevers perform a slaughter, hanging, dressing, and 
packing for them, though this process is likely to take 
days longer than most travelers can spare. 

There is entertainment to be had at the Gambling 
Golem, where cheaters in the card or dice games are 
tossed out into the street, and a local marbles game 
known as scattershields is popular. Dry goods, candles, 
lanterns, saddles, rope, and wagon wheels are available 
from a number of other shops. 

It can't be stressed enough that while the Harpells 
have little interest in the daily running of Longsaddle, it 
is undeniably their town. They rarely suffer insults, and 
never tolerate violence against themselves, their family, 



or the locals. A conflict involving the Harpells is likely to 
end swiftly and bloodily, and (unless the offender is con- 
vincingly apologetic, unconscious, dead, or forgiven of 
the wrongdoing) will often draw additional Harpells to 
support their kin. Harpell supports Harpell in all public 
matters, and no one bothers to record the numbers and 
names of those that forgot that fact. 

Aside from the Harpells, the dominant families of 
Longsaddle are ranchers: the Cadrasz, Emmert, Krom- 
lor, Mammlar, Sharnshield, Suldivver, and Zelorrgosz 
families have ranched in or near Longsaddle for genera- 
tions, and influence most of the daily life there. They set 
the market days, help resolve disputes among families, 
and broker purchases when a farmer or businessperson 
dies without an heir. They settle smaller matters and 
keep the peace as best they can, knowing full well that 
if the Harpells need to get involved in a dispute, there is 
always the possibility of an offender's being blasted into 
nothingness. 

These families are also the ones most likely to hire 
outsiders to deal with matters on the ranches, whether 
an ore raid or the appearance of lycanthropes in the 
area (though it's rumored that the latter creatures 
may be the descendants of one of the Harpells). The 
major ranching interests often hire adventurers not 
only to further their own aims or provide for defense, 
but to secretly hinder or harm one another and gain an 
advantage in their ongoing competition. Adventurers 
that go too far on such a mission can be explained away 
as foolish outlanders, and if they offend a Harpell and 
get blasted in the middle of the Low Road, there will 
be no one left to ask about the matter. My best advice 
is to be mindful of the scent of magic in the air and act 
accordingly. 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 






Mirabar 


Mirabar is a human city that rests atop dwarven cav- 
erns. On the surface, humans dominate the population, 
with some dwarves mixed in, and a handful of gnomes 
and halflings. The uppermost level of the undercity is 
mostly dwarves, with some few humans. The mixing 
of races is due to convenience of trade, preference, or 
skill; just as some few humans like to mine, to imbibe 
strong dwarven drink, and to work underground, so do 
a minority of dwarves take to the open sky, doing dock 
work, or even manning and building ships. The lower 
levels beneath Mirabar are all dwarven, as even the 
most dwarf-like human can live so deep below ground 
for only so long. Almost all of its citizens, regardless 
of race, honor Moradin and the dwarven gods, making 
Mirabar a dwarven city in spirit and ethics, if not 
entirely by population, much in the way my own Silvery- 
moon speaks to elven ideals of natural beauty. 

Long ago, the great dwarven kingdom of Gharraghaur 
stood to the west of Delzoun, delving mines near the 
River Mirar and finding great, near-endless veins of 
gems. Like many of the dwarven realms, Gharraghaur 
fell to marauding ores, which destroyed the kingdom 
and its capital city but couldn’t take advantage of the 
wealth therein. For millennia the lower city lay empty, 
until some eight hundred years ago, when Prince Ere- 
skas of Amn settled the same spot, creating the city 
of Mirabar (coincidentally echoing the dwarven “-bar" 
naming convention used for citadels throughout the 
North). It was only when dwarves returned to work 
the mines below that Mirabar began to see its for- 
tunes increase. 

Mirabar is ruled by its hereditary marchion, Selin 
Raurym, who issues edicts fed to him by the Council 
of Sparkling Stones. The council is a group of dwarves 


Everbright 

The dwarves were the first to discover the secret of treating 
their metal with everbright. The technique has been imi- 
tated by other races, to varying degrees of success. Armor, 
weapons, and other metal objects to which everbright is 
applied maintain their luster without needing to be pol- 
ished, and are resistant to natural (and, in some cases, 
magical) pitting, rusting, and tarnishing. 


and some few humans elected to make policy for the 
city, who determine where the output of Mirabar’s mines 
will be sold. Although the council has long kept Mirabar 
associated with the Lords' Alliance, it is the marchion 
who negotiates with his fellow lords. Thus far, Selin 
Raurym has proved far more capable than his predeces- 
sors at making beneficial decisions for the city, and the 
council has given him great leeway to speak for Mirabar 
outside the walls. His threat to pull out of the Alliance 
following its failure to aid the northern cities against the 
most recent ore hordes, though considered by some an 
empty gesture, has brought Mirabar more advantageous 
relationships with Waterdeep and Baldur’s Gate, some- 
thing which has not gone unappreciated by the council. 

The city’s guard, the Axe of Mirabar, exists primarily 
to deter and prevent sabotage of the mines, without 
which Mirabar would collapse. The guard also pro- 
vides swift and capable defense and law enforcement 
within the city. The wealth of Mirabar is so great that it 
maintains docks, ships, and fortified harbors on many 
of the islands in the Sea of Swords, and as such the 
city is always seeking magical and military support for 
these defenses. Where other cities might use such vast 
mountains of coin as Mirabar possesses on shows of 
prosperity, Mirabarrens use it for more functional goals, 
making sure that the city’s defenses are new, that its 
gates close securely when they are moved, that its build- 
ings and walls are strong and secure. Given the recent 
destruction of Sundabar’s surface city at the hand of 
ore armies, such expenditures are well justified, since 
no one in Mirabar wishes to see the surface city wiped 
out. It would simply be bad for business. Mirabar spares 
no expense in defending its wealth, and hires as many 
mages and adventurers as necessary to clear threats 
away from roads, investigate sabotage, and otherwise 
protect its vital trade. 

With the rise of Mithral Hall in the last century, and 
now Gauntlgrym, Mirabar fears its place as the armory 
of the North is at risk. ‘The miners, smelters, and smiths 
of Mirabar work ever harder to increase their output and 
improve their craft, while the jewelers and enamelers 
study ways to incorporate ancient techniques of melding 
dwarven, human, and elven designs together in their 
work, in the manner of old Phalorm. 

Mirabarren (or to some, just Mierren) dwarves like to 
cultivate long, wide (as opposed to tapered or pointed) 
beards and tight braids of hair growing elsewhere than 
on the chin, a fashion copied by some local humans. 

They love polished, everbright-treated sheets of metal, 
particularly copper, used as doors or mirrorlike wall- 
panel inlays. They often set gems into the pommels 
and nonworking ends of tools and weapons. Mierren 
dwarves tend to be wealthy, to have personal collections 
of unusual and rare gems, to use seals made of gems 
carved into signet rings, and to be investors in ventures 
(rather than property) up and down the Sword Coast. 
They are sophisticated and worldly, and they decry the 
isolationist and xenophobic attitudes of some dwarves. 
Mierren dwarves demonstrate their own broader 
attitudes by being the diplomatic traders and power 
brokers in trademoots and agreements in Fireshear and 
Neverwinter and everywhere else they can worm their 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 



way into, among dwarves and between dwarves and 
non-dwarves. 

To other dwarves, Mierren are translators and local 
guides and “the people who know the right people" in 
human-dominated cities everywhere along the Sword 
Coast and in much of the Heartlands. Most adult Mier- 
ren have dealings with a variety of human costers and 
merchants, taking care to avoid exclusivity or cultivate 
too narrow a range of business partners and contacts, 
so they control their own destinies and fortunes. They 
abhor the thought of humans having the slightest 
chance of dominating them. 

The wealth that flows through Mirabar has not only 
extended the reach and worldly knowledge of all Mier- 
ren, it has enabled them to indulge all sorts of personal 
hobbies, such as art collections (statuettes and paintings 
in particular). The private living quarters of most Mier- 
ren feature comfortable furniture, painted artwork large 
and small, statuary, and hanging chimes— often metal- 
lic, but always soft and pleasant, never loud or strident. 
Gems are plentiful in Mierren families and are used 
as currency and in all manner of personal adornment, 
rather than being hidden away. Semiprecious stones 
line many of the streets in Mirabar, and gorgeous inlays 
mark important corners and intersections, some so new 
that one can still smell the jewelers dust. 

Still, despite the city's overall wealth, there are rich 
and (relatively) poor Mirabarrans. Not everyone shares 
in the coin the city’s sales bring in, and wage work- 
ers whose income is determined by a day’s labor or a 
month’s output can’t hope to expect that a well-worded 
contract by an employer will enrich them in the least. 
Wealthy merchants and business owners are careful 
not to show their success ostentatiously; their clothing 
might be of richer fabrics, but still in the same styles 
and colors as the garb of poorer folks. Waiting rooms 
and front halls in the fortified homes of the rich are just 
as sparsely furnished as those in poorer homes. Keep- 
ing up the appearance of relative equality in fortunes 
is vital, for if anyone in a position to commit a violent 
act— say, a weaponsmith with access to great stores of 
swords and axes— knew just how wealthy the wealthiest 
Mirabarrans were, there would very likely be bloodshed 
before the offended parties were satisfied. 

Neverwinter 

A short while ago, Neverwinter was beset by all manner 
of damage, danger, and gloom. Now, the ores that once 
menaced the city have moved east to join their breth- 
ren in being crushed by the dwarves. The Chasm that 
rent the land has been sealed by powerful magic. The 
High Road has been cleared and rebuilt, and trade has 
resumed with Waterdeep and realms to the south. What 
was the blasted, wounded city of Neverwinter just a 
decade ago is now an exciting, humming place, where 
folk seem eager to throw off the hardships from which 
they have emerged and create a new, brighter future for 
their city. 

Nearly half a century ago, Mount Hotenow (the nearby 
volcano that perpetually heats the river flowing through 
the city) violently erupted, destroying much of Neverwin- 
ter, killing thousands, and leaving in its wake a great, 



gaping chasm that split the city. Neverwinter was in 
ruins, and external influences— from Netheril to Thay 
to Lord Dagult Neverember of Waterdeep to the agents 
of the Hells themselves— sought to exert control over 
the city. Many folk fought to stem all these dangers, and 
eventually, a measure of peace fell over Neverwinter. 

Since Dagult Neverember was deposed as the Open 
Lord of Waterdeep, he has thrown his full attention 
and effort into the rebuilding of the city from which he 
claims descent. Whatever people's opinions are of his 
claim to Neverwinter’s throne, he has proven a capa- 
ble, inspiring leader over these last few years, and the 
population has embraced him as Lord Protector. He 
engineered the sealing of the Chasm and the restoration 
of the High Road, and is seeking other ways to repair 
and improve the city. Even if he can never prove his 
descent from Lord Nasher Alagondar, the people of 
Neverwinter have accepted his leadership. (My rumored 
personal dislike of Lord Neverember has nothing to do 
with my assessment of his leadership; I merely find him 
an intolerable flirt.) 

Neverember's influence radiates outward from the 
Protector’s Enclave, centered at the Hall of Justice. With 
Tyr restored to life and his worship returning to prom- 
inence, the Lord Protector has moved into a modest, 
private villa. This sacrifice— and the renewal of Tyr’s 
faith in the previous center of his operations— is only 
further proof, to some, that Neverember deserves to rule 
Neverwinter. As yet, Castle Never remains a dangerous 
ruin, but Neverember has plans to reclaim and rebuild it 
as a symbol of the city’s rejuvenation. 

The faithful of Oghma have arrived in Neverwinter to 
restore the House of Knowledge to its former glory, but 
beyond that, shrines to all manner of gods have been 
cobbled together in every corner of the city. 

As the city restores itself, there are likely to be 
requests for ennoblement and the privileges that pro- 
vides, and certainly, trading interests will emerge. But 
Lord Protector Neverember is sure to point out that he 
is merely a protector, not a king, and so can’t invest or 
recognize anyone. Guilds may form, but it is sure to be 
years, if not decades, before any prove strong enough to 
persevere over their rivals. 

Increasingly, calls come from the citizenry for the 
enforcers out of Mintarn to be replaced by respectable, 
local guards who have a personal interest in the defense 
of Neverwinter. This public sentiment has led to some

neighborhoods organizing their own makeshift militias, 
and the Lord Protector wants to avoid conflict between 
them and the mercenaries he has hired. As a result, 
Neverember has slowly been drawing down the number 
of soldiers from Mintarn, as the citizens that grew up 
defending the makeshift Wall from threats out of the 
Chasm prove themselves capable of becoming a proper 
military force. Both Baldur’s Gate and Waterdeep have 
offered to help train the new guards of Neverwinter, but 
Lord Neverember prefers the assistance of seasoned 
adventurers to the ignominy of seeking help from his 
former city. 

With the restoration of nearby Gauntlgrym, Never- 
winter hopes to have a close ally that can provide it 
with stout armor and strong weapons. Although the 
city presently has little to offer, trade activity is rapidly 
growing in Neverwinter, as word of its rebirth opens 
it up to shipping from the Sea of Swords, goods from 
the north, and coin from the south. Adventurers come 
to Neverwinter seeking work and following rumors of 
nearby treasures, and often find additional employment 
clearing out dangerous corners of the city and escort- 
ing the ever more numerous caravans up and down the

craftfolk returning to ply their trades, that Neverwinter 
will someday again be worthy of its former epithet: the 
City of Skilled Hands. 

Opposition to Neverember’s authority still exists, but 
with no unified leadership and no other power in the 
city to which to appeal, the rebels are slowly turning 
away from their resistance and toward helping the city 
rebuild. Many of the Sons of Alagondar, a rebel group 
that initially opposed Lord Neverember, have begun to 
volunteer as replacements for the Mintarn mercenaries 
currently patrolling the city. If the Sons of Alagondar 
can be brought into line with his goals, Neverember 
hopes to use that achievement as a draw for wealthy 
Waterdhavian nobles— who have been reluctant to link 
their fortunes to a failed Open Lord who was effectively 
exiled from Waterdeep— to invest in the city and perhaps 
rebuild some of the noble villas in that district as places 
for them to stay when they do business. 

With the Chasm closed, and the wall that separated 
the rest of the city from its horrors now torn down, a 
great swath of Neverwinter lies empty, with no inhab- 
itants and plentiful chunks of stone plundered from 
ruins all across the city. Anyone who is willing to do 
so can come to this area, claim a portion of land, and 
build a structure in which to live or work. There aren’t 










yet any guilds to restrict trade or construction, and no 
nobles to be petitioned or placated. Those seeking to 
create a home or start a business can simply do so, and 
even those without skills or money can use their hands 
and backs to provide until they can set up a place for 
themselves. 

Along the river, many of the merchant villas are being 
claimed and restored by folk who have heard rumors of 
what Neverwinter once was, and might be again. Some 
have no skills to speak of, and many have no wealth, 
but all come with the desire to work and to enrich them- 
selves in the process. New stores and workshops open 
by the tenday, and workers without training offer their 
services as laborers or apprentices; those that fail move 
on to other employment, taking advantage of the mul- 
titude of opportunities the city now offers. Those with 
no other options can get work dredging or mapping the 
city’s sewers for the Lord Protector, a task made neces- 
sary by the cataclysm that created the Chasm. 

Like any city, Neverwinter isn’t without its drawbacks. 
Though most folk are willing to work, some steal as a 
means of making their living, and prey upon those who 
have little to be taken. Food is sometimes scarce, as 
inns and taverns underestimate the number of guests 
they will receive, or merchants simply run out of goods 
to sell. It’s likely to be a few years before the city entirely 
shakes itself of these ills, but for some, the uncertainties 
of life in Neverwinter are what make the place exciting. 
For many traders, in particular those who produce or 
vend the grains and vegetables needed in the city, it is 
a vast opportunity to both aid a fledgling power and get 
quite rich in doing so. 

SlLVERYMOON 

Long a powerful and influential member of the Lords’ 
Alliance— and, for its entire existence, the Silver 
Marches of Luruar— Silverymoon is what many cities 
aspire to be: a quiet, peaceful realm, where many races 
live together for common knowledge, celebration, and 
defense. The city is peopled primarily by the “goodly” 
races (humans, dwarves, gnomes, elves, halflings, and 
half-elves), but no being is turned away from Silvery- 
moon because of its race— though a drow or an ore 
proving true to one’s blood is sure to be punished in 
full for transgressing against the peace of the city. I will 
make no secret of my love for my home in the following 
summary, but I will endeavor to be as evenhanded as I 
can in describing it. 

The Gem of the North is a stunning place of sweeping 
curves, soaring towers, and structures built into the 
living trees. To many elves, the city is a reminder of the 
ancient elven cities of old; some call it the Myth Drannor 
of the North, even nowadays after the restoration and 
subsequent fall of that fabled city. Even where stone is 
employed in construction, ivy and other living plants 
grow through, over, or around most structural elements, 
giving most of the city a green cast. 

Despite its arboreal architecture, Silverymoon is 
very much civilized, boasting schools of music and 
magic, a great library, bardic instruction, and temples 
or shrines to Mielikki, Oghma, Silvanus, Sune, Tymora, 
and Mystra. Knowledge, both the acquisition of it and 


the wisdom that comes from diligent study, is the real 
treasure of Silverymoon, as much as magic or wealth 
could ever be. 

While it is easy and pleasing enough to get lost among 
the trees of the city, anyone who comes close enough 
to the River Raurin is awed by the vision of the Moon- 
bridge: the great arch of silvery force that spans the 
water. Even for those native to the city, it is a powerful, 
moving sight, and some claim to see the goddess Lurue 
(for whom the city is named) dancing above the motes of 
the bridge when no one else is watching. 

Given its beauty, a visit to Silverymoon is among the 
most memorable experiences most non-Silvaeren might 
have. Even among those that regularly fight monsters or 
handle magic, Silverymoon is a place of quiet, contem- 
plative beauty, splendid opportunities for learning, and 
respite from the harsher realities of the North. 

Folk seeking knowledge that has been lost or hidden 
often come to Silverymoon seeking a means to find it, 
whether by studying in the Vault of the Sages or perus- 
ing the Map House for the location of a lost city or grove. 
These are but two of the many buildings and houses 
of learning in the Conclave of Silverymoon, the great 
center of knowledge and wisdom that forms much of the 
city’s southern part. If a map, a book, or a spell exists 
anywhere in Faerun, knowledge of it likely exists here, 
even if only a mere mention in a tome or a recollection 
of one of the city’s great sages. Candlekeep might be the 
greatest assembly of written knowledge anywhere in 
the world, but in the end, that place represents accumu- 
lation for its own sake. Silverymoon is where study and 
wisdom are honored. If your charge is to translate an 
ancient tome in a lost language, to learn the proper into- 
nation of a complex song, or to better understand the 
cryptic writings of a long-dead sage, there is no better 
place to seek aid than Silverymoon. 

It is an easy thing to come to Silverymoon seek- 
ing knowledge of one subject, and find oneself so 
enraptured by the study that it takes a lifetime to accom- 
plish— or to realize that it was the study, rather than 
the sought-after fact, that one truly desired. Although 
tutors and sages in every field can be found In Silvery- 
moon, rarely is interaction with one so simple as to ask 
a question and be provided an answer. Learning to cast 
a particular spell, to find an ancient ruin, or understand 
a specific secret might involve undergoing months of

instruction to prove to a teacher that the knowledge 
imparted is being entrusted to a deserving person. 

In the east of the city is the High Palace, capital of the 
city and of the fallen state of Luruar. Lord Methrammar 
Aerasume lives in this high, slender-spired structure. 
The merlons of its battlements are carved to resem- 
ble unicorn heads. The soldiers of the High Guard, 
clad in shining silver plate, protect the residence and 
seat of power, and keep those out that don’t have busi- 
ness within. 

Silverymoon has long been led by a high mage. One of 
the longest ruling, and certainly the most influential of 
these, Alustriel Silverhand, stepped down more than a 
hundred years ago to become the High Lady of Luruar, 
and was succeeded by Taern Hornblade. Though 
he ruled wisely over the last century, Taern recently 
relinquished the city’s leadership to High Marshal 
Methrammar Aerasume, Alustriel's half-elf son and the 
leader of Silverymoon’s armed forces. Taern still speaks 
for the city on Methrammar’s behalf at meetings of the 
Lords’ Alliance, as the new ruler is far too blunt and 
impatient to suit the other lords of the compact. 

Silverymoon is defended by several forces. First are 
the Knights in Silver, the shining-armored warriors 
that patrol the city and the nearby lands. Officers of the 
Knights are well trained in tactics and military history, 
and have high opinions of their own abilities and those 
of their comrades— opinions that are very often borne 
out. They are bolstered by the Spellguard, a cadre of 
powerful wizards and sorcerers that train in battle 
magic. Last is the city’s own mythal , the great field of 
magical force that prevents the inhabitants of the city 
from engaging in all manner of spellcasting. In partic- 
ular, spells that summon flame, conjure creatures, or 
permit teleportation fail when their target is within the 
bounds of the mythal. Should a foe try to traverse the 
Moonbridge, the span can be willed (by the city’s rulers, 
and certain others specially attuned to the mythal) out 
of existence, dropping attackers into the river. 

No city’s prestige was harmed more than Sil- 
verymoon’s by the recent war and the subsequent 
dismantling of the Silver Marches. Though they tried to 
bolster the nearby cities, the Silvaeren were accused of 
providing insufficient and incompetent support to Sund- 
abar, the surface population of which was entirely wiped 
out. In the end, all of the dwarven states stepped away 
from Luruar, and without the support of those kingdoms 
or the leadership that Alustriel provided at its founding, 
the confederacy collapsed. Taern Hornblade isn’t as 
powerful a voice in the Lords’ Alliance as Alustriel was, 
either, in part because his affection and respect for the 
former High Lady has been extended, in large part, to 
her sister Laeral, now the Open Lord of Waterdeep. 

Despite reports of her death decades ago, rumors 
have recently reached the city that High Lady Alustriel is 
in fact alive and active in southern lands. Seemingly, she 
has contacted neither her son nor her former comrade, 
Taern Hornblade— though given how widely known 
Taern’s hopeless love for the High Lady was, and the 
long years he took to overcome his grief, it’s not certain 
how he would react upon receiving proof of her survival. 


Silverymoon has nonetheless long been known as a 
safe haven for Harpers in the North, because the city 
doesn’t see the aims of the Alliance as conflicting with 
Those Who Harp. Where other cities’ rulers might see 
the presence of the Harpers as a threat to their author- 
ity, Silverymoon desires an end to tyranny as fervently 
as the Harpers do, and thus the greater good is served. 
At the same time, some Silvaeren believe that the city’s 
tolerance of certain other members of the Alliance 
(some mention Mirabar, others Baldur’s Gate) is some- 
what naive. 


The Wards of Waterdeep 

Waterdeep has long been divided into several large regions 
called wards. To locals these are essential to Waterdeep, 
but outsiders often lose track of which ward they’re in or 
what a ward’s name signifies. The names of the wards sug- 
gest the contents of the buildings and the character of the 
activity in each one, but no laws exist that restrict a given 
activity or class of people to any specific ward. 

Castle Ward. As the name indicates, Castle Ward con- 
tains Castle Waterdeep, Piergeiron’s Palace, and many 
other public buildings of the city. This ward is home to 
mainly the wealthy or influential who can’t count them- 
selves among the nobility. Other structures are taken up by 
educational or religious concerns that primarily serve the 
city at large, not the residents of the ward. 

Dock Ward. Most of the city’s harbor area is located in 
Dock Ward, as are the businesses and warehouses that 
depend on the city’s newly restored harbor. It’s a crowded 
neighborhood of many winding streets, where folk are 
comfortable making deals that might in other places pro- 
voke the displeasure of the law. 

Field Ward. Of relatively recent vintage, the Field Ward 
stands between the inner and outer north walls of the city 
(an area formerly used as a caravan grounds). This ward 
grew up in a messy, unregulated fashion and is home to 
many of the poorest residents of the city. 

North Ward. Home to many noble villas, townhouses, 
and a great many inns, North Ward is the neighborhood of 
the respectably wealthy. 

Sea Ward. Those whose fortunes are on the rise build 
their homes in Sea Ward, and they join many long-estab- 
lished noble families in residence. This area in the north- 
west of the city is home to much of the city’s wealth, the 
location of the grandest villas of the city’s noble families 
(except for those in North Ward). 

Southern Ward. Stables, warehouses, and shops related 
to overland trade dominate Southern Ward. Most residents 
are hardworking folk that load and unload caravan carts, 
and otherwise perform low-paying work. 

Trades Ward. A narrow slice of land between the Castle 
Ward and the City of the Dead, Trades Ward is the center 
of commerce for the city, with most of the smaller transac- 
tions and respectable trade taking place here. 

City of the Dead. The city’s walled cemetery, the City of 
the Dead is the only place in Waterdeep where it is legal to 
bury the deceased. It is used by many citizens as a public 
park during the day, a lovely green space of pretty mau- 
soleums and grand statues in which to escape the city’s 
hustle and bustle. 

Underdiff. While not considered by many to be a ward 
of the city, the little villages and many farms that sprawl 
across the land east of the city were lawfully incorporated 
into Waterdeep when it moved a barracks and training fa- 
cility to the area. 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 


Waterdeep 

Rising from the shores of its deep harbor to ring the 
great mountain standing tall out of the Sea of Swords 
is Waterdeep, the City of Splendors and the Crown 
of the North. To all of Faerun, this great metropolis 
stands as the pinnacle of what a great city might be, in 
wealth, influence, and stability. Here, the citizens work, 
the nobles sneer, and the great masked lords plot and 
scheme, all while merchants dance between them to 
collect their coins and continue profiting as best they 
can. Waterdeep’s shops and merchants offer goods 
of every sort from every corner of Toril, and even the 
rarest of items can be procured, given sufficient coin 
and patience. Adventurers lacking one or the other can 
very easily find all manner of employment, from simple 
escorting of caravans, to guarding nobility, to investigat- 
ing a ruin or rumor of monsters anywhere in the North. 

Though it has stood for hundreds of years, Waterdeep 
is only now returning to its status of a century and a 
half ago. The recent disruptions began when the gods 
walked the Realms and slew each other before the 
eyes of mortals, until they walked back to their divine 
domains through the very streets of Waterdeep itself. 
Decades later, more deities began dying off, magic 
failed, and all manner of catastrophes started altering 
the very nature of the city. Lord Neverember wasted the 
city’s navy and then, instead of rebuilding it, hired sail- 
ors out of Mintarn (and profited from the endeavor). 

Now, the City of Splendors is on the mend. The harbor 
has been cleared of the broken ships that made up the 
former district of Mistshore, and Waterdeep again has 
its own navy. The city’s Guard (its army), Watch (police 
force), Navy, and it famous Griffon Cavalry are all being 
reformed, but all of that might be a matter of years in 
the settling. A plague chased most residents out of the 
Warrens and Downshadow, and living or digging below 
the city’s surface has been deemed illegal except by 
those authorized by the lords to do so. Somehow, even 
the air seems fresher. In the words of one wise moon elf 
matron (whose status as my aunt has positively no bear- 
ing on her wisdom), “Waterdeep is back to where it was 
when I was a lass.” 

Perhaps most surprising of the newest developments 
is the return of Laeral Silverhand to Waterdeep. Long 
thought dead, she reemerged only recently, and swiftly 
rallied the masked lords to support her supplanting of 
Dagult Neverember as Open Lord of Waterdeep. Very 
few remember Lady Laeral from her previous time in 
the city, but those elves who have been living in there 
for the last century claim she is more reserved than 
she once was. The new Open Lord doesn’t speak of her 
family— any mention of her children, her late husband 
(the fabled Blackstaff, Khelben Arunsun), or any of her 
famed sisters is cause for her to cut short whatever 
conversation may be in progress at the time. Her rela- 
tionship with the current Blackstaff, Vajra Safahr, is 
cordial, but the two are seldom seen in one-on-one con- 
versation, and most think that Lady Laeral has little to 
learn from a mage who isn’t nearly her equal. 

As always, the Open Lord is selected and supported 
by several masked lords, who bear masks, robes, and 


amulets to disguise themselves when publicly sitting in 
judgment or council, and who make policies for Water- 
deep. Every Waterdhavian has suspicions as to whether 
this or that influential citizen is or isn’t a lord of the city, 
and some are willing to make their beliefs public, but 
few who are confronted in such a way have ever claimed 
to be a lord, and none of those have also produced proof 
of that assertion. 

Not hidden at all are the other lords of the city— the 
nobles of Waterdeep, whose high-nosed behavior and 
heavy-handed spending establish fashion in the city, 
which in turn creates trends all across the North for 
clothing, weaponry, favored trinkets, music, and any 
other preference that can be changed at a whim by 
those with enough coin to afford the expense. More than 
seventy-five noble families call Waterdeep home, repre- 
senting between them all manner of business interests, 
rivalries, and internal strife. 

Being a noble carries with it a great deal of advantage. 
Operating from one’s place at the head of the economic 
and social hierarchy, a noble can easily lift a mediocre 
craftperson out of obscurity, dash the hopes of a wealthy 
merchant of ever securing another contract within the 
city, or provide the backing an ambitious adventuring 
band needs to find fame and great wealth. The only 
true competition nobles face is from one another. Such 
rivalries are the source of much gossip and intrigue as

the nobles of Waterdeep always try to maintain at least a 
veneer of civility in their squabbles. 

Although they seldom agree on much, one matter 
that all the noble houses see the same way is that their 
status should not be tainted by newcomers, and cer- 
tainly not by anyone so brightcoin as to purchase ones 
way to a noble title. When during Lord Neverember’s 
tenure it became legal for impoverished houses to sell 
their titles, and thus allow others to become noble, 
many leaders of the old-blood houses were apoplectic, 
particularly after some purchasers lost all their coin and 
sold their titles again within a season or two. Open Lord 
Laeral Silverhand has, to the relief of those leaders, 
seen the folly of this decision, and gathered enough sup- 
port among the Lords of Waterdeep to not only reverse 
it, but to restore titles and lands to noble families who 
lost them through folly. The change has won her much 
support among the nobles. Now Zhents and Thayans 
and Baldurian merchants have coin enough to buy prop- 
erty within the city, if they choose, but that is no reason 
to award them noble titles and legal rights, instead of 
merely a mansion, for doing so. 

Yartar 

Situated in the fork where the Rivers Surbrin and Des- 
sarin join near the Evermoor Way, Yartar is a fortified 
town that, were it not for its own petty, internal squab- 
bles, might wield more influence among its fellows 
in the North. Currently, it is most remarkable for its 
barge-building operation (and that industry’s impor- 
tance to the commerce of other settlements) and its 
annual fairs. 

Each summer, except in years when Shieldmeet 
occurs, a vast Hiring Fair is held in Yartar, during which 
all sorts of undesirable folk gather north of the town 
looking for work as guards, miners, farmhands, guides, 
or other unskilled laborers. For the most part, those who 
attend this fair are brutes, bandits, freeholders whose 
lands can no longer sustain them, or Uthgardt who wish 
to be among “civilized” folk for a short time— but occa- 
sionally, a strong hand or a skilled warrior can be culled 
from the bunch. While this event is going on, Yartar is 
overrun with visitors it would rather not welcome, who 
steal goods, sell wares in the street (sometimes those 
they have just stolen), meet unscrupulous contacts to 
hand off coin, information, or purloined items, and 
engage in the occasional spell duel. It’s quite common 
for a new adventuring company to come into being at 
one of these fairs, when those who stand out from the 
crowd because they have legitimate skills to sell gravitate 
toward one another and decide to form a group. 

In those years when Shieldmeet falls, the town is 
instead treated to a great festival on that day, sponsored 
mainly by the local temple to Tymora, the Happy Hall of 
Fortuitous Happenstance. The Shieldmeet festival fea- 
tures a number of games of chance, skill, and bravery, 
from dice and darts, to drunken running, to wrestling 
and other physical contests. Occasionally, the Tymoran 
priests use this festival to identify adventurers whom 
the goddess has called to a particular task, selected 
for a blessing, or otherwise marked for some undeter- 
mined destiny.

Whether during the Hiring Fair or the Shieldmeet fes- 
tival, each summer at least one adventuring band seems 
to get its start in Yartar. Most fall into obscurity, but the 
Smiling Company— the still-active portion of a larger 
band of warriors who gathered in Yartar nearly a decade 
ago— still enjoys moderate success, and makes annual 
contributions to the Happy Hall. 

Yartar is ruled by a Waterbaron who is elected for life. 

The current Waterbaron is Nestra Ruthiol, a hot-tem- 
pered woman who is wickedly calculating; though she 
is free with her words and her insults, she seldom takes 
action against rivals unless she is sure such can be done 
to the most efficiently painful effect. During my last visit 
to Yartar, accusations arose against the Waterbaron that 
she had murdered a man, Kaidrod Palyr, who was later 
revealed to have been her lover. His body was found in 
the river, with the soaked remnant of what appeared to 
be Nestra Ruthiol's favorite cloak. That she loudly and 
publicly argued with Palyr's wife, Tiarshe, shortly before 
the accusations came to light did little to help her rep- 
utation, or the impression of her innocence. When she 
was finally cleared of the charges, Waterbaron Ruthiol 
made it clear that she didn’t wish to speak of the matter 
again, and she would ensure that anyone who brought it 
up in official dealings would be quite unhappy with the 
results. Though there are whispers, it has not been men- 
tioned in her presence since. Some blame the murder 
on the Hand of Yartar, the local thieves’ guild, but I 
believe that Kaidrod was killed, and the Waterbaron 
was implicated, in order to free up the post for one of 
her rivals within the city. 

It is conflicts and schemes such as this that keep 
Yartar from gaining prominence in the North. If the 
town can overcome its internal problems, take advan- 
tage of what its fellows in the Lords’ Alliance can offer, 
and find a way to reap greater profit from its position 
along major trade routes— where it stands as the gate- 1 

way to all the settlements of the northeast— Yartar 
might soon grow in size, wealth, and influence. Physical 
growth would require clearing terrain for further set- 
tlement and building another encircling wall to protect 
settlers— and additional guards hired to protect those I 1 

who do the work. 

With its location near two great rivers and its prox- 
imity to a third (the Laughingflow, forming a trio the 


CHAPTER 2 I THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 





57 





locals creatively call the Three Rivers), Yartar is a fish- 
ing town, and its tables have fish as fare at every meal. 
Fresh crabs* eels, and other river life are available both 
to eat and to purchase, and serve as a primary means of 
income for the fisherfolk of the town. 

The other major industry of Yartar is barge building. 
Most of the region’s river barges are built, or at least 
begin their service, in Yartar, and the works of the 
town’s bargewrights are famous all up and down the 
Dessarin and its tributaries. It is the importance of Yar- 
tar’s barges to the commerce of the North that earned 
the town a place in the Lords’ Alliance, to ensure that 
Yartar doesn’t fall to enemies and cause upheaval in the 
trade network along the rivers. 

What can't be transported to or from Yartar by barge 
comes and goes by caravan instead, and the town’s 
location makes it a key stop for most caravans pass- 
ing between Waterdeep and Silverymoon. In Yartar, a 
caravan can arrange for swift repairs, replacements of 
wagon wheels, carts, or full wagons, or the replenish- 
ment of tack and other accessories. 

Because Yartar has so few industries, and fewer close 
neighbors, its merchants are often in direct competition 


Fallen Dwarven Kingdoms and Their Marks 

The North is littered with the remnants of many dwarven 
realms. Although much of the wealth at these sites has 
been plundered by monsters and adventurers over the 
centuries, evidence of the settlements and their borders 
remains graven on cavern walls, trail markings, and scat- 
tered coins. Some of these realms, and the marks that 
bear testimony to their presence, are detailed below. 

Haunghdannar. The oldest evidence of dwarven settle- 
ment in the North comes from the former site of Haungh- 
dannar. This small coastal realm arose nearly sixty-five cen- 
turies ago in the northern Sword Mountains and along the 
Sword Coast, then fell quickly and mysteriously some fif- 
teen hundred years later. Some records suggest that many 
of the citizens, driven mad by the sea, sailed westward and 
never returned. Mark: A mountain, with a left-facing fish, 
surmounted by a seven-pointed star. 

Gharraghaur. The dwarves of Gharraghaur were the 
original delvers beneath the earth at the site of present-day 
Mirabar. The kingdom was founded soon after Haungh- 
dannar but didn’t last as long; twelve hundred years later it 
succumbed to a horde of ravaging ores. Mark: Four verti- 
cal, diamond-shaped gems, three set in a triangle, with the 
largest in the center. 

Besilmer. Nearly six thousand years ago, shield dwarves 
established an aboveground realm in the Dessarin valley 
that they named Besilmer. They were the builders of two 
noted landmarks on the Sword Coast: the Stone Bridge 
and the Halls of the Hunting Axe. Less than three hundred 
years after it came into being, Besilmer was overrun and 
destroyed by a horde of humanoids and giants. Mark: a 
wheel over a plow. 

Delzoun. The great Northkingdom of the dwarves, 
Delzoun was carved out of the rock beneath the area 
known until recently as the Silver Marches. Founded soon 
after the fall of Besilmer, Delzoun remained a great power 
for nearly four thousand years, until ore hordes and sub- 
terranean monsters did it in. Many of Delzoun’s greatest 
works, citadels such as Sundbarr and Adbar, survive and 
thrive yet today. Mark: a horizontal, double-headed ham- 
mer in a triangle of three sparkling gems. 


with one another, and have neither the resources to 
seek new customers, nor the space or funds to explore 
new trades. As a result, a good deal of the gossip, thiev- 
ery, and assault in Yartar has at its roots one merchant 
trying to get the upper hand on a rival, either through 
damage of goods, intimidation of workers, or theft of 
patrons and customers. 

To curb and control rowdiness, the Waterbaron 
employs the Shields of Yartar, a mounted force of guards 
who police the town, keep order, and chase off the Uth- 
gardt raids that occasionally menace the lands nearby. 
The Shields are housed in the Shield Tower, a fortified 
structure on the west bank of the Surbrin (the town sits 
primarily on the east), whose outer wall has frequently 
been torn down and rebuilt. It’s rumored that guardian 
skeletons rise when unauthorized folk tread the ground 
between the walls, but no one has tested the area to see 
if its magic still functions; even if it doesn’t, more than 
a hundred angry warriors charging out of the tower 
at trespassers is enough danger to scare people out of 
pursuing the idea. A fortified bridge connects the banks 
between the tower and the town proper. 

More impressive than either the Shields or the Shield 
Tower is the Waterbaron’s Barge. This massive vessel 
can carry two hundred soldiers or seventy-five Shields 
of Yartar with their horses. Its sides above the waterline 
are armored with iron. Behind its walls stand multiple 
crossbow contraptions, each able to fire a dozen bolts 
at once. When brought to bear against a force on the 
riverbank, the Shields loose two volleys against their 
enemies, then bring the Barge ashore and charge. No 
raiders have stood firm against such an assault. 

In the center of town is the Waterbaron’ Hall, a grand 
structure that is both the ruler’s home and the location 
where she hears audiences. Feasts are often held here, 
though more often, the hall sees activity in its side 
rooms, where merchants dealing in large quantities of 
goods, or making deals and proposals that affect the 
entire community, can meet in comfort. 

Dwarfholds of the 
North 

Who am I? Son, I’ve got hairs on my back longer 
than that little beard o'yours. I fought with Emerus to 
retake Felbarr, and marched with every dwarf king of the 
North to win back Gauntlgrym. Lost half my foot to an 
ores blade, and slew every damned one that got in my way 
marching home. If I want to sit and enjoy my old age now 
that we finally drove the ores back, I'll do just that, and 
courtesy be damned. Eve earned my rest. Your little lordling 
don't like it, let him come and tell me himself. I'm not get- 
ting up until I finish my ale. 

— Drorn Waranvil, to the envoy of the Marchion 

of Mirabar 

The history of the dwarves in the North is a long and 
violent one, dating back more than six millennia. Before 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 







mm 




there was a Standing Stone in the Dalelands, or a 
Waterdeep, or a Myth Drannor, there was the brief (in 
dwarven terms) glory of Besilmer, and the realms of 
Haunghdannar and Gharraghaur. Ruins now, to be sure, 
but these kingdoms lasted longer than almost any living 
realm of humans, even if their works have been forgot- 
ten by humans and dwarves alike. 

The greatest and most recent of these dwarven realms 
was Delzoun, also called the Northkingdom. It stretched 
from the western edge of what was then the Narrow 
Sea (later, the Great Desert of Anauroch) west almost to 
present-day Silverymoon, and from the Ice Mountains 
to the Nether Mountains. Citadels Adbar and Felbarr 
were fortresses of Delzoun, and Mirabar, Mithral Hall, 
and Sundabar all owe their existence to that ancient 
kingdom or its descendants. Fabled Gauntlgrym, said 
to be touched by the presence of Moradin himself, was 
built by Delzoun’s dwarves— first as a mine, and then as 
a city. It was the dwarves of Delzoun who built Ironmas- 
ter, too, and all the great mines and renowned forges of 
the North reside in the halls of the dwarves. 

Now, when shield dwarves invoke the name of 
Delzoun, they are calling upon the glory of all their past 
accomplishments: every feat of architectural mastery, 
every fine blade or crushing warhammer forged, every 
kingdom and battle— won or lost— in defense of their 
people and the folk around them. The name is as much a 
battle cry and a badge of honor as it is a call into history, 
for although every dwarven settlement now has its own 
masters, kings, and queens, they all respect the memory 
of the great hammer of Delzoun and the glorious king- 
dom it represented. 

The details in this section are drawn from the exten- 
sive teachings of Drorn Waranvil, a longbeard (dwarf 
elder) who is a retired veteran of the Iron Guard of 
Citadel Adbar and the Citadel Guards of Felbarr. Drorn 
fought in the ore wars of both this and the last century, 
and helped free Citadel Felbarr (twice) and Gauntlgrym 
before he put down his warhammer a few years ago 
and began to chronicle his experiences for the benefit 
of younger dwarves seeking to know more about their 
heritage and about the world of today from the proper 
perspective. 

Citadel Adbar 

In the extreme north of Faerun, near the Cold Wood, 
lie the Ice Mountains. There, in the bitter cold, stands 
the eternal fortress of Citadel Adbar, the last great rem- 
nant of the Northkingdom, and glory of fallen Delzoun. 
For nearly eighteen centuries, Adbar has stood strong 
against every threat from every foe, and stood fast, to 
the great pride of its residents and our people through- 
out the region. 

From the surface, Citadel Adbar looks less like a 
castle or a human city than a mountain carved to suit 
the purposes of the dwarves who live there. The two 
great towers that stand uppermost are ringed with 
vicious dragonspikes to keep large creatures from land- 
ing to attack the structures directly. The great chimney 
of the city’s central foundry stands between them, 
belching smoke like a volcano about to erupt. Ringing 
the citadel is a host of platforms, battlements, and arrow 


slits from where defenders can fire crossbows at anyone 
foolish enough to attack the city. 

For centuries, Adbar has stood as the living monu- 
ment of the Northkingdom. Already the main fortress 
of Delzoun when that empire fell, it only grew in impor- 
tance to the dwarves of the region as other settlements 
were overrun by ores, assailed by goblins, or simply 
disappeared. An ore horde hoping to take Citadel Adbar 
might rage against its walls, but to little effect, until the 
great, unyielding granite became the anvil against which 
they were smashed. The great drawbridge allowed none 
to pass except welcomed guests, and such guests were 
few indeed. Standing unconquered, it was the bastion of 
dwarven hope, glory, and trade. 

But now, for the first time in memory, my fellow 
Adbarran seem truly frightened at the prospect of 
opening the citadel to any outsiders. Perhaps they are 
reacting to the recent losses of the war, or the lack of 
leadership shown by our new king, or mere war-wea- 
riness, but for whatever reason Adbar’s gates are even 
harder to move with soft words than they have been in 
the past, and there are fewer traders coming out of the 
city nowadays. 

The recent ore wars have cost the kingdom dearly, 
both in warriors and in leadership. In a short time, our 
long-ruling king, Harbromm, died. His unprepared twin 
sons shared the rule until the elder, Bromm, was him- 
self killed by a dragon, leaving young King Harnoth with 
the rule of the ancient citadel. 

What followed was a great bleeding of the realm. 

Much was required to break the North out of the great 
siege the Many-Arrows ores held it under. There are 
also whispers that King Harnoth led his Knights of the 
Mithral Shield out into the field to vent his rage and grief 
on the ores in ill-advised assaults, winnowing down 
the once great Knights to fewer than two dozen. The 
Iron Guard, Adbar’s army, appears as strong as ever it 
did, but given the extent of the losses against the ores, 
it would be little surprise if their newer recruits were 
more smiths than warriors, serving their realm out of a 
sense of duty rather than a desire for battle. I served in 
the Guard for a century, but I’ve yet to test the newcom- 
ers to see just what they’re made of. 

If you are fortunate enough to be granted entry to 
Adbar, be wary of walking around on your own. Within 
the citadel are traps, deadfalls, and other hazards in var- 
ious places waiting for someone to approach a protected 
location incorrectly. A guide, if you can find one, is nec- 
essary for newcomers to get around safely. 

Beneath the citadel proper, miles of dwarf-sized 
caverns form a confusing maze that frustrates most 
non-dwarf visitors. These tunnels are what remain of 
the early mining efforts inside the mountain. Below 
them lie the great ore mines of today, constantly being 
worked by crews of engineers and laborers. 

By law, the mines are forbidden to visitors— even 
non-Adbarran dwarves— except in times of great emer- 
gency. So, given the impregnable nature of the fortress, 
no one not of Adbar has yet been privileged enough to 
witness what occurs down below. The citadel’s Great 
Wheel, a most impressive sight even to a dwarf, is an 
ever-turning water wheel that provides power to keep 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 





Adbar’s foundries, mines, and other operations working 
at all times. Near the wheel is the Hall of Moradin’s 
Forge, a place of worship that reminds every dwarf of 
the Soul Forger’s strength and enduring protection. One 
can’t help but feel safe in its presence, and a true dwarf 
is home in the warmth of Moradin’s shadow. 

Given the current state of the surface lands around 
the citadel, it is no surprise that Adbarran are even 
more suspicious than usual of caravans and visitors that 
approach the city by means of an underground route. 
One such road arrives from the west, connecting Adbar 
to Mithral Hall and Mirabar through the ancient tun- 
nels of Old Delzoun. Another tunnel leads south from 
Adbar to meet the Lowroad, which connects the ruins of 
Ascore in the east to Citadel Felbarr in the west. 

No matter where they come from, all roads leading to 
Adbar converge so that all travelers must confront the 
great pair of iron doors known as the Caravan Door. 

Like the rest of Citadel Adbar, this gate has never been 
breached. Mention the idea of that happening to an 
Adbarran dwarf, if you’re looking to get a laugh. 


w 

The Dirge of Delzoun 

The tale of the great Northkingdom of the shield 
dwarves, the Dirge of Delzoun takes more than a day 
to sing in its entirety. The song recounts the history of 
Delzoun, from its founding millennia ago to the dis- 
persal of its cities and the settlement of the successor 
realms of dwarves in the North. It is performed only in 
Dwarvish, and no known written copies have ever been 
reported. Only a privileged few non-dwarves have ever 
heard the Dirge in its entirety, and dwarf bards who want 
to perform this epic must demonstrate great skill in both 
singing and history. 

The current dirgekeeper is Ollyn Grimtongue of Citadel 
Felbarr, who was appointed by King Emerus Warcrown a 
century ago, and is the only dwarf permitted to add new 
lines to the ballad. It is believed that, now that Emerus has 
gone to the Halls of Moradin, Grimtongue is preparing a 
stanza honoring his former liege as a hero who rivals the 
champions of Old Delzoun. 

■^r— w- 

Citadel Felbarr 

Among the eldest and grandest of the Delzoun holds, 
Citadel Felbarr was built more than three thousand 
years ago— a span of time beyond the ability of younger 
races to comprehend. With great wealth, obtained 
through profitable trade with Netheril and some of the 
older human settlements of the North, the dwarves 
forged themselves a mighty fortress. 

Like most dwarven settlements, Felbarr was built 
around mining. With the fall of Netheril, the reduction 
of trade along the Lowroad, and signs that the mines 
beneath the city were reaching the end of their useful- 
ness, the Felbarran abandoned the citadel after nearly 
two millennia, whereupon a force out of Silverymoon 
occupied the fortress shortly thereafter. Within half a 
century, the ores had come to realize the weakness of 
the much smaller garrison, and Felbarr was taken by 
the savages following a four-month siege. The ores gave 
the place their tribal name, and the Citadel of Many 
Arrows stood as a fortress for ores for more than three 
hundred years. 

The recent story of Citadel Felbarr is the story of my 
fallen friend, King Emerus Warcrown. In 1367 DR, 
Emerus led a force of dwarves to seize on the advantage 
when, to our surprise and delight, another ore horde 
assaulted the ores inside the Citadel of Many Arrows. 
Biding his time until the invaders broke down the gates, 
Emerus vanquished both tribes of ores and reclaimed 
the citadel for the dwarves. After a first, brutal winter, 
Citadel Felbarr was restored: its forges were relit, and 
the sound of dwarven hammers began ringing through 
its halls once again. It was a proud time when we 
welcomed the following summer with Felbarr back in 
dwarf hands. 

In the most recent war, the ores again took Citadel 
Felbarr, but with the help of King Bruenor Battleham- 
mer and an alliance of dwarves from across the North, 
King Emerus again retook Felbarr, slaying every ore 
that managed to enter the city and the tunnels below. 

The grateful king and his loyal warriors then agreed 
to accompany Bruenor to Gauntlgrym, and there aided 
him in reclaiming that ancient city as well, but Emerus 
was mortally wounded in the effort. Bruenor honored 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 








King Emerus by naming him the second king of 
restored Gauntlgrym (after King Connerad was granted 
the honor of first kingship posthumously), but for 
most Felbarran dwarves, this honor is an empty com- 
fort, because their beloved hero-king has been taken 
from them. 

Now ruling Citadel Felbarr are King Emerus’s dis- 
tant kin, King Morinn and Queen Tithmel, who were 
recently married in a union designed to join separate 
claims to the throne into one family. Tithmel’s claim to 
the throne is the stronger by a small degree of kinship, 
but Morinn is a quieter, more thoughtful ruler. Queen 
Tithmel has ever been a warrior, and some Felbarran 
are afraid she may run headlong into the wrong battle 
before the couple can provide the realm with an heir, 
and so they hope that King Morinn’s softer influence 
will help to temper her impetuous nature and keep the 
city strong through the trying times following the recent 
conflicts. Although the two monarchs share the rule of 
the city, and speak with absolute authority, their citizens 
are wise to listen to what both have to say before decid- 
ing how to act on royal edicts. 

Most humans know Citadel Felbarr from a distance. 
They see only a great raised road winding through a 
vale of broken rock, brooded over by two barbicans 
known as the Hammer and the Anvil. Two other fortifi- 
cations loom higher still over the road, embedded in the 
nearby cliffs and built atop them. These are the North 
Vigil and the South Vigil. Far beyond them, the massive 
Rune Gate stands at the end of the road to give entrance 
into Felbarr, but visitors rarely pass through it. 

Like most dwarven cities, Felbarr exists almost 
entirely underground. However, since it has been 
invaded by ores more than once, no accurate maps of 
the city’s full interior are known to exist, preventing 
would-be attackers from gaining their information. 
Dwarves, even those visiting from other realms through 
the connections with the Lowroad, have little trouble 
finding their way around, but humans, especially those 
who can’t read Dwarvish or the shorthand runes carved 
throughout the city, have a far more difficult time. 

Following the war, most Felbarran applauded the 
dissolution of the Silver Marches. In its time of great- 
est need, no races other than dwarves moved even the 
slightest to aid Citadel Felbarr, when more assistance 
and better coordination might have prevented not only 
that citadels fall, but Sundabar’s as well. Felbarran 
merchants remain willing to trade with the cities of the 
North, and will aid the other dwarven kingdoms when 
necessary, but it is doubtful that Queen Tithmel will 
ever consider an alliance with humans like the one that 
created Luruar, even if King Morinn might. 

Gauntlgrym 

Gauntlgrym has a complex and contradictory history, 
the gist of it depending on who’s doing the telling. 
Humans have one story, of what they know from recent 
years, but for us dwarves, Gauntlgrym is an ancient 
place, first delved as a mine in the earliest days of Old 
Delzoun. All sorts of myths persist about the great 
mithral doors of the city, but at its start, Gauntlgrym 
was simply a mine. When they delved too deeply, the 


dwarves there discovered the presence of a great being 
of flame, sealed the mines, and left. Only later, when 
the humans begged the Delzoun dwarves to build one, 
was there ever a city in Gauntlgrym. It arose because, 
this time, the dwarves succeeded in harnessing the 
primal power of fire in the depths, thus creating 
the Great Forge that made the city possible. Or so 
the stories go. 

Despite all the quests undertaken by adventurers 
down the centuries, none ever truly found the ancient 
city until the ghosts of Gauntlgrym's former denizens 
began calling to living dwarves to seek out the city. And 
some did— or tried to, anyway. Shortly thereafter, the 
ore wars began anew, and nearly every dwarf’s attention 
turned back to the existing dwarfholds and the dangers 
those places now faced. Gradually, as the ores were 
pushed back and the dwarven cities secured anew, 
those delvers began to recall their promises to their 
ancestors. Further, when the war ended, King Bruenor 
Battlehammer of Mithral Hall promised to lead the 
dwarves to Gauntlgrym and reclaim it for the dwarves of 
the North. 

It took fierce fighting to drive out the creatures that 
had claimed the city from below, and no one is quite 
sure who or what— aside from the drow— had tried 
to occupy Gauntlgrym, but in the end, the dwarven 
armies prevailed, and Bruenor claimed the victory. 

King Emerus Warcrown of Citadel Felbarr was gravely 
wounded, and Bruenor proclaimed him the second king 
of Gauntlgrym before his death. When dear Emerus 
passed on, Bruenor assumed the rule of Gauntlgrym, 
once again abdicating the leadership in Mithral Hall. 

There are some who think that King Bruenor has 
designs on a great, restored empire of Delzoun, with the 
dwarves of all the North— from Ironmaster to Adbar and 
Sundabar— swearing him fealty. Others fear that he will 
punish those settlements that didn’t contribute warriors 
to the cause to retake Gauntlgrym, but those folk don’t 
know the returned king very well. If he wants a reborn 
Delzoun, may Moradin and his children grant him the 
wisdom to do it right, and the fortitude to see it through. 
It’s a throne I wouldn’t wish on anyone. 


The Canticle of Gauntlgrym 

Passed down by dwarves throughout the North for cen- 
turies, the Canticle of Gauntlgrym is now something of 
an anthem for the reclaimed city. It is often sung on the 
road by dwarven travelers on their way to make a life in 
Bruenor’s halls. 

Silver halls and mithral doors 
Stone walls to seal the cavern 
Grander sights than e’er before 
In smithy, mine, and tavern 
Toil hard in endless night 
In toast, oh, lift yer flagon! 

Ye’ll need the drink to keep ye right 
At forge that bakes the dragon. 

Come Delzoun, come one and all! 

Rush to grab yer kin 

And tell ’em that their home awaits 

In grandest Gauntlgrym! 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 


The rise of a dwarven city so close to the coastal 
powers of Neverwinter and Waterdeep brings about its 
own special opportunities and concerns. Surely, once 
they get their forges going properly, the dwarves will sell 
armor and weapons similar to the excellent pieces they 
forged in the eastern cities of Old Delzoun, and this mer- 
chandise may lessen the demand for goods from more 
distant dwarven settlements. In particular, Sundabar is 
worried that its weapons will no longer be sought after 
along the Sword Coast, and is looking southward for 
new markets in Elturgard and elsewhere. 

Beyond the great mithral doors of the city lies the 
great Iron Tabernacle, the holy center of Gauntlgrym, 
which the priests of all the Morndinsamman are metic- 
ulously restoring to honor the gods. Every portion of the 
city has a road or passageway that eventually leads back 
to this site, a vast cavern of crisscrossing walkways and 
great stairs. In its lowest levels, the Tabernacle holds the 
resting places of countless of Gauntlgrym’s dead. Schol- 
ars have set about cataloging the lineages recorded 
here, to give King Bruenor a more complete picture of 
the bloodlines of the city, and to determine whether any 
of the living clans have relations or honored dead among 
those interred. 

Deeper still is the Great Forge of Gauntlgrym, where 
in times past hammers rang off adamantine anvils to 
forge wonders from every conceivable type of metal. 

Now the forge might be brought back to life again, and 


soon— the priests and spellcasters of the city are work- 
ing on a means of containing the great heat emanating 
from the Fiery Pit where the being of pure flame is con- 
tained, to harness the unquenchable fire as the dwarves 
of old did. 

Ironmaster 

I’ve never set foot in Ironmaster myself, but I fought 
beside Storn Skulldark, a young warrior-priest of 
Clangeddin who was taking a sort of “vacation” from it 
in order to help reclaim Gauntlgrym. His descriptions 
of life in Ironmaster confirm much of what I’ve heard 
of the place, and so what I relate to you now is truth as 
solid as Moradin’s anvil. 

The dwarves of Ironmaster don’t want you there, and 
they want little from the wider world that their traders 
can’t bring back for them. Approaches to the vale in 
which their city lies are clearly marked with the symbol 
of Ironmaster: an anvil on a diamond. Such a mark is 
your only warning, and those ignorant of its meaning 
court death at the hands of dwarf patrols that will attack 
any interlopers. Some innocents have been spared and 
turned back, but no one should rely on the mercy of a 
dwarf of Ironmaster. 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 


If you were to pass beyond the borders and into 
Ironmaster itself, you would behold one of the won- 
ders of the world. The great Shaengarne river rushes 
through a deep canyon of rock and ice in a series of 
cascades and waterfalls, throwing up freezing froth as 
it bashes against massive spires of rock that rise from 
the riverbed. Ironmaster is built in these spires and 
into the walls of the canyon, the tunnels and towers 
strung together by high bridges and cliff-side walkways. 
To hear Storn talk of the place, you would think that 
dwarves scrabbling about at such heights through the 
open air was as normal as badgers in a burrow, but I 
don’t mind saying I set aside my ale after he spoke of it. 

Ironmaster owes its existence to the restlessness of 
Ilgostrogue Sstar, who left Citadel Adbar long ago with 
nearly a quarter of the population of the Northkingdom, 
headed for what is now Mirabar. By all accounts he was 
mad, and hoped to extend a dwarven empire to the sea. 
Once there, and settled, he grew restless again, and 
headed farther west with his troop, finally settling his 
nerves in sight of the sea over the Shaengarne River. 
There the dwarf leader died, and his heir demanded that 
the folk that followed him build a settlement in tribute 
to Clanmaster Sstar’s grand vision of a dwarven empire. 
The dwarves found extensive deposits of iron in the 
hills surrounding their valley, and so named their city 
Ironmaster. 

Ironmaster proved true to its name, and the dwarves 
have been tunneling out under to tundra for centuries, 
following the veins of metal. This brought them into 
contact with duergar of the Deepkingdom a generation 
back, and Ironmaster has been at war with them ever 
since. Storn was himself a veteran of many battles for 
tunnel territory, and despite being so young that not 
a hair of his beard was white, his knowledge of tun- 
nel-fighting tactics rivaled my own. 

Their war with the duergar isn’t Ironmaster’s only 
secret, however. My friend Storn wielded two silvered 
axes, as befits any devote follower of Clangeddin Silver- 
beard, but when I returned to him an axe he had thrown 
in the heat of battle, I noted its remarkable weight, and 
Storn told me that the blade was not steel beneath, but 
adamantine. I questioned him more about this, and 
his readiness to tell me of its origin speaks to both 
the abundance of adamantine among the Ironmaster 
dwarves and of my friend’s innocence about the wider 
world. Apparently, the dragon-worshiping humans of the 
distant island of Tuern have long given raw adamantite 
mined from their island to the smiths of Ironmaster, 
and they render finished works of adamantine back to 
the Northlanders in return. Of course, not all the ada- 
mantine makes it back to the Northlanders, but since 
the humans are ignorant of the means of forging ada- 
mantine, they are likely none the wiser. What a trove of 
arms and armor must lie hidden beyond Ironmaster’s 
borders! Ah well, surely they put it to good use against 
the duergar. 

I don’t think Storn will mind my sharing his city’s 
secrets. You can go and ask him if you like. He’ll no 
doubt enjoy another little “vacation” from the war in 
the tunnels. 


Mithral Hall 

The ancestral home of Clan Battlehammer, Mithral 
Hall was a place of great potential wealth when it was 
founded in the days of Old Delzoun. Dwarves of Clan 
Battlehammer left Citadel Adbar, heading west in the 
hope of finding mithral deposits hidden in the south- 
ern spurs of the Spine of the World. These they found, 
and so began the delving of Mithral Hall, with Clan 
Ironshield founding Settlestone nearby as a means of 
buffering the market for the products of the hall’s ore. 

Mithral Hall enjoyed centuries of profit before its delv- 
ing permitted the shadow dragon, Shimmergloom, to 
break through into the world. A settlement of thousands 
was reduced to fewer than three hundred— all of them 
too young, too old, too weak, or too ill to fight— who fled 
to Settlestone. There, they waited for months for word 
from King Garumn that their lands were again safe. 
When messengers to the city didn’t return, it was clear 
that Mithral Hall had been lost, and its dwarves headed 
north, first to Ironmaster, where they were treated with 
such distrust that they couldn’t remain, and then to 
Icewind Dale. 

When Garumn’s grandson, Bruenor, was old enough, 
and sure of his path, he gathered allies to retake his 
former homeland, and went on a great many adven- 
tures with the group later known as the Companions 
of the Hall. At the end, Bruenor slew the dragon 
Shimmergloom and reclaimed Mithral Hall for Clan 
Battlehammer after almost two centuries. 

After Bruenor regained the throne, his personal friends 
attracted some powerful enemies to Mithral Hall, includ- 
ing the drow of Menzoberranzan. This is one reason, his 
supporters claim, that the king abdicated in favor of his 
ancestor Gandalug Battlehammer: to protect the people 
from his personal enemies. Some of Bruenor’s detractors 
claim it was wanderlust that made him leave, but none 
will bother (or dare) to ask him. In any case, when Ganda- 
lug died, Bruenor did his duty and resumed the throne. 

Before Bruenor died, he was instrumental in gaining 
dwarven support for the Treaty of Garumn’s Gorge, 
which brought peace between the dwarves and the 
ore Kingdom of Many-Arrows. When the ores, in time, 
broke their treaty and made war on the North, he 
returned from the dead almost as though he had been 
summoned to rally the dwarves to defend themselves 
and punish their enemies. Some say he delayed receiv- 
ing the rewards of Moradin’s own Dwarfhome to return 
and aid his fellows and kinsfolk. Such sacrifice, such 
loyalty, makes a dwarf king worthy of the crown. 

Bruenor Battlehammer, the Eighth and Tenth and 
Thirteen King of Mithral Hall, no longer leads Mithral 
Hall or the Battlehammer dwarves that live there. 

Since his return to life, he has refocused his attention 
on Gauntlgrym, and doesn’t claim the kingship of his 
former home. Instead, the crown has been offered to 
General Dagnabbet Waybeard, granddaughter of Brue- 
nor’s ally, the great general Dagna. 

When last I visited Mithral Hall a few years ago, I 
passed through the rebuilt ruin of Settlestone, where a 
garrison of two hundred stands to protect the approach 
to the Mithral Hall. Once I reached the gates, the 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 



Clan Stoneshield 


massive granite doors proved to be heavily guarded, 
and nearly impossible to open from the outside. Mithral 
Hall’s defenders call themselves the Host of the Hall, a 
disciplined, well-armored cohort that is willing to defend 
the city to the last dwarf. The famed Gutbuster Brigade 
is part of the Host, battleragers who strike fear into any 
enemy intelligent enough to realize whom it is they face. 

Travelers allowed inside the city are housed in upper- 
level guest chambers just inside the labyrinth of caverns 
known as the Maze. From there, paths lead down into 
the middle levels of the city, past its various furnaces, 
and onward to either the lower levels and deeper mines 
(where guests aren’t permitted) or the undercity (where 
non-dwarf visitors are prohibited). 

Despite its recent reputation and the growing legend 
surrounding its most famous king, Mithral Hall is 
much more a mine than it is a city. Like most dwarven 
realms, it lost significant numbers to the ores, and saw 
its population further depleted by Bruenor’s quest for 
Gauntlgrym and the resulting permanent relocation of 
some of his people. As a result, Mithral Hall’s numbers 
are sorely diminished at present, and it remains to be 
seen whether its fortunes will follow suit. 


CHAPTER 2 I THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 



SUNDABAR 


Like Mirabar, Sundabar was a dwarven settlement 
atop which a human city was built. Sundabar’s recent 
fall should serve as an example to my fellow dwarves 
of what can happen when the balance of power shifts 
toward the surface and into human hands. 

The city is descended from the citadel of Sundbarr, a 
stronghold of Delzoun constructed two thousand years 
ago around a strange volcanic rift that would come to 
be known as the Everfire— a mystical source of endless 
heat for the city’s smithies and foundries that allowed 
Sundabar to produce works of great wonder. Sundbarr 
was led by a Forgemaster, the smith most skilled at 
working with the Everfire. When one Forgemeaster died 
or another surpassed his or her ability, leadership of 
Sundbarr changed hands. 

So it was until the fleeing remnants of Ascalhorn 
were pursued to the citadel’s doorstep some time later. 
Then the Forgemaster of Sundbarr aided the humans 
in fighting off the demons and other monsters that 
chased them. In recognition of a human saving his life 
during the fight, the Forgemaster permitted the refugees 
to settle on the surface, rather than forcing them to 
depart once the battle was done. The partnership that 
grew between dwarves and humans became renowned 
throughout the North, and the surface city of Sundabar 
was built up into a mighty fortress of commerce. 

However, as the humans flourished above, the dwarf 
population dwindled, and eventually the Forgemaster 
was overtaken in prestige and influence by the Ruling 
Master of Sundabar, who came to speak for the human 
guilds and merchants of the surface city. One such 
ruling master. Helm Dwarf-Friend, was so beloved 
and respected that his descendants were able to crown 
themselves kings, something no dwarf before or since 
has dared to do in Sundabar. 

King Firehelm, Helm’s grandson, was the king in Sund- 
abar when the city fell to the ore horde. He did not survive. 
Beyond that tragedy, the recent war did horrific damage 
to Sundabar and the humans on the surface. A dragon 
dropped great stones on many of the buildings above, and 
a good portion of the city’s outer wall was destroyed. Most 
of Sundabar’s military leadership was wiped out when 
the building they were meeting in was crushed. Despite 
the best efforts of Aleina Brightlance of Silverymoon’s 
Knights in Silver to organize a defense, and the valiant 
efforts of the Sundabar garrison, ores streamed into the 
city, slaughtering the human population on the surface 
and driving what few defenders remained into the caverns 
below, and from them many fled through the Underdark. 
The dwarves of the undercity barricaded themselves in 
the Everfire caverns, and waited. When the ore warlord 
Hartusk left only a token garrison behind in the city to 
slow pursuers, the dwarves emerged from below and set 
about slaughtering every ore and goblin in Sundabar. 

Sundabar is now a dwarven city in its entirety; the 
human population is gone. Efforts to clear away rubble 
and debris from the attacks are slow, as most dwarves 
remain in the sheltered undercity, and those few who 
have duties on the surface have taken over the buildings 


with the least damage, scavenging stones from ruined 
structures to reinforce those that can be salvaged. 

Before the war, Sundabar’s surface streets were 
cobbled smooth, but many of those roads have been 
destroyed by falling stones, torn up for ammunition or to 
repair walls, or simply neglected. Now, the surface city 
is a hollowed-out ruin. Some believe that the city above 
will be allowed to wither into oblivion, with the excep- 
tion of the sturdy double wall that surrounds it (and 
which the dwarves have already repaired). The tem- 
ples of human deities stand abandoned. The walls are 
patrolled by a few sharp-eyed sentries, whose duty is to 
report what they see and to turn away unwanted visitors. 

In the center of the upper city, the Circle still stands 
around the ruin of the Masters Hall, ready to receive vis- 
iting caravans, livestock, and merchants. However, few 
such visitors arrive, and fewer still are welcomed, as Sund- 
abar prefers to engage in trade nowadays only with other 
dwarven cities through the Underdark. Were it within the 
Forgemaster’s power, he would see to it that all commerce 
entering and leaving the city do so by means of under- 
ground traffic, so that most surface trade routes could be 
abandoned entirely. 

Sundarren trust of outsiders is low, and their assess- 
ment of humans lower still. During the war, of all the 
human cities, only Silverymoon made any attempt to aid 
Sundabar, and that aid was (to dwarven minds) far too 
little and too late. As a result, with the Silver Marches 
dissolving, Sundabar wasted no time withdrawing from 
the Lords’ Alliance as well, officially severing formal ties 
with the human realms of the North except for those 
necessary for trade. Given that such trade is now a rare 
occurrence, most of the human realms see Sundabar 
as jealously guarding its wealth and cravenly hiding 
beneath the surface, while the rest of the region does 
what it can to recover from the recent conflicts. Sund- 
abar’s losses in buildings and in population have done 
nothing to diminish the contents of its overflowing cof- 
fers, and despite its current state, the city remains one 
of the wealthiest in the North, though most of that coin 
rarely leaves the city now. 

The notion of kingship has come up among the 
dwarves in the undercity, but the Forgemaster has 
rejected the idea. Let the dwarves tend to themselves, 
surely, but there should be no king in Sundabar. I don’t 
know whether Flamestoker’s reticence is false modesty 
or true wisdom, or if he is waiting for a warrior-king to 
claim Sundabar as part of a larger realm. 

Thornhold 

West of the High Road and hard to the coast near the 
Mere of Dead Men lies what humans refer to as Thorn- 
hold. Once the keep of a petty warlord of the Margaster 
family of Waterdeep, it was captured and claimed by a 
paladin as part of the Second Troll War. For many years 
the Knights of Samular, an order of Tyrran paladins 
founded by one Samular Caradoon, used Thornhold as 
its base, though the hold remained the personal prop- 
erty of the Margaster family. 

For a brief time a little more than a century ago, 
Thornhold fell into Zhentarim hands. When the 
Zhentarim marched through the Underdark to claim 


Thornhold, they passed through the caverns of Clan 
Stoneshaft, which had lived below since before the 
time the surface city was erected by humans. Though 
the Zhentarim killed or enslaved many of the dwarves 
there, they failed to destroy the clan. The survivors soon 
escaped, regrouped, and retook Thornhold by force 
under their leader, Ebenezer Stoneshaft, with the aid of 
Samular’s descendant, the Harper Bronywn Caradoon. 
After the fortress was reclaimed, in a gesture of respect 
and gratitude, Caradoon bequeathed its custody to Clan 
Stoneshaft. 

The dwarves of Thornhold are all of the Stoneshaft 
clan, and because tunnels from their home connect to 
the castle, they refer to the place as Stoneshaft Hold; 
they use “Thornhold” only when a non-dwarf in a con- 
versation is confused and an explanation must be made. 
By habit and nature, Stoneshaft dwarves are secretive 
(even for dwarves), but nonetheless always eager to 
hear what’s afoot in Waterdeep, particularly any doings 
involving the Margaster family, whom they see as 
foes who will one day attack their home to regain it or 
destroy it if they can't take it back. 

To most humans, Thornhold is merely the fortress 
above the surface, a castle of gray stone with a thick, 
curving wall and a two-towered central keep. They don’t 
know of the caverns below that lead to the Stoneshaft 
clanhold. The cliff facing the sea is so sheer that no wall 
need be built to protect that side of the hill on which 
Thornhold sits. The castle is utterly without adornment 
or ornamentation, and only crenellations and arrow 
slits break the solid face of stone. Within the castle, 
surrounding the bailey, are small buildings of wood and 
plaster that hold animals and are used for smithwork, 
candlemaking, laundry, wood repairs (including wagons 
and the like), and brewing beer. 

Long ago, Thornhold was a profitable stopover for car- 
avanners, adventurers, and other travelers journeying 
north along the High Road past or through the Mere 
of Dead Men. For decades, the expansion of the Mere 
in the calamities of the Spellplague cut off most travel 
along the High Road. During that time, the Stoneshafts 
lived in relative isolation, stockpiling their ore, refined 
metal, and crafts. Stoneshafts are known for the fine 
metal- and gemwork they craft, considered by most to be 
works of art worn as personal adornment. 

The Margasters of Waterdeep believe that they still 
have a right to Thornhold. The fortress sits on the rees- 
tablished High Road leading to Neverwinter, so it is no 
wonder that the nobles wish to profit from the fortress’s 
location along that route. The Knights of Samular also 
show interest in restoring their outpost at Thornhold as 
a prelude to sorties into the Mere, and there is talk that 
these desires may lead to a curious alliance between the 
grasping human nobles and the high-minded paladins. 

Stoneshafts fear the politics of powerful Waterdeep 
will lead to an assault on Thornhold. They have thus 
been preparing for siege by gathering supplies and rein- 
forcing Thornhold’s defenses. 

Stoneshaft dwarves can taste the wealth, bustling 
energy, and constant excitement of nearby Waterdeep, 
and want to share in it. They don’t want to be forced into 
isolationism, and kept away from Waterdhavian society 

CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 




and the riches of trade. The Stoneshafts aren't blind to 
House Margasters ambitions, and they know that they 
must bring in profits if they hope to weather the chal- 
lenges to their home. They re very careful to avoid being 
caught alone, fearing kidnap or torture at the hands 
of hired agents of the Margasters eager to learn the 
secrets of their defenses. For the same reason, only the 
Stoneshaft elders know and plan all the details of those 
defenses, so any single dwarf doesn’t know everything 
and can’t reveal it. 

Stoneshafts like and are interested in the full variety 
of clothing and fashions, music, jokes and current news 
and rumors, and household goods and tools that Water- 
deep offers. They tend to favor maces and morningstars 
and other bludgeoning weapons, plain armor with full- 
face helms that conceal a wearer’s identity and that 
have plates to protect the vital areas of a knocked-down 
dwarf, and spicy foods. 

Island Kingdoms 

What makes me such an expert on sailing off the 
Sword Coast? Well experience, for one. Survival for an- 
other. I've been doing this longer than most of my readers 
have been alive, and this is the third version of this book I'm 
offering. I write one of these only every half-century, and if 
you think the purchase price isn't worth the heaps of coin 
you'll make by selling my work to your customers, you're a 
fool. Don't want it? Don't buy it. 

- Gardorra Burr, to a Waterdhavian bookseller 

West of the Sword Coast lies the Sea of Swords, and 
beyond that the Trackless Sea, a vast expanse separat- 
ing Faerun from whatever lies to the far west. Between 
the shore and the unknown are a number of islands, 
some large and others so small they lack names of their 
own. These island nations trade— and war— with Faerun 
and one another, just like any mainland nation. 

The information below is drawn from Fifty Years 
at Sea, Volume the Third, by Gardorra Burr, a gnome 
sailor who has spent most of her two hundred years tra- 
versing the Sea of Swords. 

Mintarn 

I don’t know what the people of Mintarn did to attract 
Beshaba’s ire, but they surely have her attention. For 
as long as I can remember, Mintarn has lived in the 
shadow of the dragon Hoondarrh— called the Red Rage 
of Mintarn since he dwells on an island close by— but 
for just as long, the people of Mintarn have been able 
to purchase the dragon’s mercy. Now a series of events 
conspire to threaten their power to pay the dragon, as 
well as their other aspirations on the Sword Coast. 

Mintarn has long been a neutral ground for various 
forces— a place aloof from the conflicts between the city- 
states of the coast and the rivalries of the Northlander 
isles. Any ship— be it pirate, privateer, or merchant 
vessel— could dock at Mintarn and find a warm wel- 
come. Many treaties were struck on its shores, and 
when peace couldn’t be achieved, soldiers and ships of 


Mintarn hired themselves out to various power groups, 
with no fear of retribution on Mintarn. 

Not long ago, Mintarn was awash with coin. Dagult 
Neverember invested heavily in the island, creating a 
ship-building company, combat-training facilities, and 
even lending his coin to the yearly tribute to Hoondarrh 
when other means fell short. The White Sails company 
in which he invested grew to become Mintarn’s premi- 
nent supplier of mercenary ships and soldiers. 

Things only improved when Waterdeep wasted its 
navy chasing Northlander pirates. Then Neverember, 
acting as Open Lord of Waterdeep, relied on his con- 
nections to Mintarn to draft a new mercenary navy for 
the city. What’s more, Neverember took it on himself to 
raise Neverwinter from the ashes, hiring more merce- 
naries of Mintarn to serve his needs as that city’s Lord 
Protector. 

With funds from two of the greatest cities of the 
Sword Coast filling its coffers, Mintarn knew a pros- 
perity of which its people had never dreamed. It’s true 
that the same tide that had coin flowing into Mintarn 
drew much of its young and vibrant people outward, but 
those they left behind were comforted by the knowledge 
that their family and friends didn’t leave for war, but for 
much safer duties. 

The trouble started, not surprisingly, with Hoondarrh. 
Though Mintarn made yearly tributes to the great wyrm 
and was always careful to neglect not a copper, old 
Hoondarrh was known to sleep for decades at a time, 
and the folk of Mintarn took their agreement with the 
dragon for granted. But something awoke him early 
a few years ago, and it was as if the red bastard could 
smell the gold coming into the island. Although Mintarn 
had made proper tribute, Hoondarrh landed atop Castle 
Mintarn, toppling two of its towers with his weight, and 
roared a demand for more treasure, right then, and in 
future tributes. 

Of course, the folk of Mintarn scrambled to meet the 
impatient wyrm’s demands. Even if they had all the sol- 
diers shipped away to Neverwinter and Waterdeep, what 
could they hope to do to mighty Hoondarrh? 

Things got worse recently when Neverember was 
deposed as Open Lord of Waterdeep. The Lords of 
Waterdeep have decided to reestablish their own navy, 
and they’ve told the soldiers of Mintarn to leave the city 
or take a commission among the navy or the city’s other 
armed forces. Now in Neverwinter, Lord Neverember 
has decided to do away with a mercenary force as well. 
He says he wants to instill a sense of civic pride among 
the folk of Neverwitner, but many in Mintarn see it as 
a betrayal. Neverember is a cunning man. I think with 
Hoondarrh active, the Lord Protector is simply cutting 
his losses. He didn’t get the nickname Dagger just 
because his first name is Dagult. 

Mintarn had been playing the game well, but now it 
finds itself backed into a corner with few moves left to 
make. The coin is no longer flowing into its harbors, 
and many of its best and brightest have decided not to 
return. There’s talk of hiring adventurers to slay Hoond- 
arrh, but Hoondarrh’s hoard must be massive. If that’s 
not enough of a draw to dragon slayers, then there’s 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 


no amount of money Mintarn could offer that would 
sweeten the deal. 

I like Mintarn. It has cozy inns, and they make a 
brilliant green wine unique to their island. But, there 
are safer harbors during the current storm. Maybe in 
another decade or two I’ll try Mintarn again. 

In the case that you visit, here are a few other things 
you should know of Mintarn. 

Every five or six years, a new tyrant— yes, that’s what 
they call themselves— emerges on Mintarn, ruling the 
island kingdom in the name of preserving its status 
as a neutral ground and a free port. A few years ago, 
Her Tyrancy was Bloeth Embuirhan, the supposed 
great-granddaughter of a tyrant from a century ago. 
She ruled the island through its most prosperous 
days, but odds are that the folk of Mintarn (and maybe 
herself as well, if she has her wits bout her) wants 
someone else on the throne now. 

Despite its open harbors and many fine establish- 
ments, Mintarn remains a loosely settled island. There 
are farms and homesteads, to be sure, but also wide, 
open spaces between them, and enough land that 
anyone could make a small living if so inclined. 

Skadaurak 

The Red Rage of Mintarn dwells in this mountain that 
rises from the sea north of Mintarn. I’ve never heard of 
any treasure hunters making it out alive, but those who 


give tribute to Hoondarrh say they sail into a sea cave 
and leave it on a sandy beach within. More caves are 
said to lead out from that bay, one even going straight 
up into the ceiling. Sometimes the tribute carriers can 
hear Hoondarrh’s breathing from one of the caves: great 
inhalations, exhalations, and deep rumbles of slumber. 
When they can’t hear such noises, you might think folk 
of Mintarn would be inclined to explore Skadaurak, but 
as it was explained to me, the lack of the dragon snoring 
might mean he is away hunting somewhere, but it could 
just as easily mean he is present, watching, and holding 
his breath. 

The Moonshaes 

Cloaked in mists, the rocky cliffs of the Moonshae Isles 
rise high above the surf of the Sea of Swords, their tops 
clothed in ancient forests. The Moonshaes lie due west 
from Mintarn— and Baldur’s Gate, and Candlekeep, and 
even Amn, for that matter: this great stretch of islands 
is nearly half as long as the Sword Coast, enclosing the 
Sea of Moonshae. 

On the southern isles live the Ffolk, humans ruled by 
their High King, Derid Kendrick, from the fortress of 
Caer Callidyr on Alaron. The Ffolk worship a goddess 
they call the Earthmother; her druids gather in sacred 
groves on the islands. Some of these groves hold moon- 
wells, magical pools that the druids say the goddess 
uses as her windows onto the world. 

The northern isles are the territory of the Northland- 
ers, who spread south from Ruathym to settle here,

and have fought occasional wars with the Ffolk in the 
centuries that the two groups have uneasily shared 
the islands. 


Alaron 

The largest and most populous isle of the Moonshaes is 
Alaron. The Ffolk stronghold of Caer Callidyr overlooks 
a bay south of the Fairheight Mountains, at the northern 
edge of Dornall Forest. The forest is a perilous place, 
filled with goblins, worgs, and their ilk. The deeper one 
goes, the more otherworldly the woods become, with 
fey creatures leading travelers astray— or to their doom. 
Even the High King’s rangers walk the forest with care. 

Rumor has it the Rookoath dwarves of the Fairhe- 
ight range— bolstered by Clan Rustfire of the isle of 
Gwynneth, and adventurers out of Callidyr— have won 
victories against the local ores and their shadow dragon 
master. High King Derid hopes to forge an alliance with 
the dwarves, but thus far they have spurned the aid of 
the crown. 

Meanwhile, Kythyss, a port town on the Great South 
Head of Alaron, has been hiring mercenaries to guard 
caravans running north to Callidyr. Caravan masters 
there are always looking for help, if you’re willing to 
brave the road for a while. 


Gwynneth 

Over my lifetime, the isle of Gwynneth has become ever 
more fey and mysterious, home to the elven realm of 
Sarifal, under the rule of High Lady Ordalf. 

Sarifal shares the island with the reclusive mountain 
kingdom of Synnoria, the home of the Llewyr elves, plus 
a few small shield dwarf settlements, and the ruins of 
Caer Corwell, the former Ffolk settlement on Gwyn- 
neth. High King Derid wants to reclaim the old citadel 
and rebuild it as an embassy, but has yet to secure Lady 
Ordalf’s consent to do so. 

Gwynneth is also home to Myrloch Vale, a lush valley 
nestled in the mountains with the shimmering waters 
of the Myrloch to the south. Druid circles are active in 
the Vale, allied with the elves and the fey creatures of 
this area. 

In the north of the island, High Lady Ordalf’s son, 
Prince Araithe, leads the struggle against the darker fey 
of the forest of Winterglen. The prince is a pragmatist 
willing to accept aid in fending off his people’s foes, and 
so has been known to allow adventuring companies to 
cross the Strait of Alaron and land on Gwynneth, if they 
pledge to aid the cause. 

Korinn Archipelago 

The Korinn Archipelago is dozens of rocky, rainy, 
and windswept islands populated mostly by North- 
landers, who herd sheep, fish the nearby waters, and 
occasionally go raiding or pirating. Dozens of separate 
settlements are their own mini-kingdoms with little that 
unifies them besides a shared Northlander culture. 

There’s no safe harbor for outsiders; you just have no 
idea what you are dealing with. For other Northlanders, 
the settlement of Westhaven on Pandira serves as a neu- 
tral ground where Northlanders of all stripes who ply 
the waters of the Sea of Swords might come to port and 
wait out a storm or resupply. 

Moray 

To the west of Gwynneth, Moray is a land at war with 
itself. The embattled Ffolk of Caer Moray struggle to 
keep the port town open so that Dynnegall, farther 
inland, can receive vital goods and supplies. 

These supplies sometimes include reinforcements 
to deal with the threats of the island, which are many 
and varied: the Black Blood tribe of Malar-worshiping 
werefolk, the giants of the Trollclaw Range in the north, 
and the ogres and ores of the Orcskill Mountains in 
the south. 

The Ffolk of Moray are loyal to the High King. They 
hope for a return to a unified Moonshaes under the 


Valkur, Hero-God of the Northlanders 

While Northlanders revere many other gods — Auril, Um- 
berlee, Talos, and Tempus, in particular — they see mighty 
Valkur as the most important. This hero-god is unique 
to the Northlanders and embodies the qualities that 
Northlanders most admire: fierceness, cunning, courage, 
strength, and sailing skill.

CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 


Kendrick banner and are determined to hold on long 
enough to see it. 

Norland 

North of Moray lies Norland, the stronghold of the 
Northlanders of the Isles. Much has happened among 
the Norls of late, weakening their grip on the Moon- 
shaes, but I fear High King Kendrick lacks power to 
capitalize on it. 

In recent years, a Northlander woman calling herself 
the Storm Maiden arose as a battle leader among them, 
which was unusual because Northlanders don’t allow 
women to raid or fish. Said to blessed by both Valkur 
and Umberlee at her birth, the Storm Maiden gathered 
great numbers of Norls to her banner, and it seemed she 
might contest the king for control of Norland. However, 
a decade ago, she seemed to be consumed by the power 
of Umberlee, and she drove her followers on a mad 
quest to control the Sea of Swords. When at last she 
was defeated at sea, she and her ship vanished into the 
waves. She is known to be unable to drown, and many 
people fear her return. 

Rault the Wise, king of the Norls, lost both his elderly 
son Olfgaut and grandson in battles against the Storm 
Maiden, leaving succession in question. He has a 
granddaughter of great spirit and wisdom, but in the 
male-dominated Northlander society— and so soon after 
the disastrous rise to power of the Storm Maiden— it is 
unthinkable that rule should fall to her. 

Oman’s Isle 

The last time I set foot on Oman’s Isle was just after the 
Moonshaes had unified, and it was a peaceful, lovely 
place. It had sheep, farms, and fishing boats, and plenty 
of folk willing to trade the gold from their mines for 
goods from the mainland or other islands. Now, Oman’s 
Isle is a blasted place is controlled by giants, especially 
fomorians, that hurl huge stones at any ship that comes 
too near the coast. If you do make it to shore, bring 
friends, and plenty of weapons— it’s a dangerous place, 
but might be worth the risk. I can scarcely imagine the 
reward Jarl Rault or High King Derid would offer to the 
adventurers who reclaimed the ruins of Iron Keep, once 
home to the isle’s rulers. 

Snowdown 

The little isle of Snowdown, south of Alaron, is a pos- 
session of Amn, where Lady Erliza rules from Caer 
Westphal. She is the second of her name, noted for her 
striking resemblance to her great-grandmother, the first 
Amnian ruler of the isle. 

Since taking possession of the place, Snowdown's 
occupiers have cut down its woods, stripped its mines, 
and choked its waterways with the refuse of the over- 
worked Ffolk under their rule. Lady Erliza and her 
soldiers have ruthlessly put down several rebellions, 
and the Ffolk here refer to her as “Bloody Erliza.’’ Some 
Amnians believe the isle is becoming more trouble to 
hold on to than its diminishing exports are worth, and 
further uprisings are almost certainly brewing amongst 
the Ffolk, quietly supported by Alaron. 


Northlander Isles 

Well to the north of the Moonshaes and west of Faerun 
are the home islands of the Northlanders, which exist 
as they have for centuries. The greatest of these islands, 
Ruathym, holds the oldest settlements the Northlanders 
claim, and from there, all manner of northern kingdoms 
and legends have sprung. 

The Northlander Isles are scoured by strong winds 
and powerful waves, and also suffer biting, bone-chilling 
cold for most of the year. In deepest winter, the inlets 
are choked with ice, and fog lingers late into the day, if 
it breaks at all. Most wear furs to keep out the cold, and 
those going to war supplement their protection with 
thicker hides, and helms lined with wool or fur. They 
disdain magic and glorify battle, to the point that most 
communities grow restless when they don’t have an 
enemy to fight. 

Because the Northlanders are good at fighting and 
sailing, and perfectly willing to attack ships close to 
their shores, best to be cautious around any North- 
lander Isles, especially if you haven’t been assured of 
safe passage, and often even then. 

Northlanders pay homage to several deities, but 
they most honor Valkur, a hero-god of their own who 
exemplifies the qualities their warriors hold most dear. 
Take care not to question or insult this veneration in 
their presence. 

Gundarlun 

The fisherfolk and merchants of Gundarlun are more 
like their mainland cousins than most island folk. 

Unlike other Northlanders, they arc less apt to start a 
fight with folk they don’t recognize. Because of their 
more peaceful bent, you’re more likely to be able to 
safely get fresh water and supplies in Gundarlun, though 
you should be prepared to trade generously during 
your stop. 

More than a dozen settlements pay homage to the 
king in Gundbarg. They profit from the island’s reputa- 
tion as a safe stopover. Though Gundarlun might not 
provide the best seaworthy warriors, nevertheless ship 
s that are looking to make repairs, take on sailors or 
sail-menders, or store large cargoes are likely to find 
their needs met here. 

Purple Rocks 

If you seek shelter during a storm, you might find it 
in the many islands of the Purple Rocks. It was once 
my great fortune to find safe harbor at the port village 
known as Ulf of Thuger. The welcome I received was 
nearly as warm as I might have found among the Gunds, 
and I found the Rocklanders to be a fine audience for 
my tales of travel and adventure. However, something 
makes me think I shouldn’t return. 

On the day that the storm broke, I emerged from 
the longhouse in which I had been hosted and beheld 
a well-tended and organized settlement with green 
pastures and full fishing nets. The ship’s crew and I 
were dealt with cordially by everyone, and the ship was 
already repaired and prepared for our leaving, the Rock- 
landers having apparently worked through the night to 
make it ready. 

CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 




69 




We left on good terms, and it wasn’t until we were well 
away that we realized we all shared a strange apprehen- 
sion. We had not seen much of women while we were on 
the island, which was to be expected since Northlanders 
typically house guests well away from the homes, farms, 
and forges that are the Northlander womens domain. 
But we also neither saw nor heard any children or young 
men, and never once did we see any old men or women. 
Indeed, I hesitate to say that any man among the North- 
landers we met had a single gray hair on his head or in 
his beard. This strange fact, and the Rocklanders’ weird 
custom of giving any human figure in their art the arms 
of their totem— a many-tentacled squid— makes me leery 
of a return. 

Ruathym 

The island of Ruathym is the ancestral homeland of 
all the Northlanders who live on the islands of the Sea 
of Swords and the humans who would go on to found 
old Illusk, now Luskan, and spread out as the Illuskan 
people. The warlike folk of Ruathym know they have 
this legacy, and they consider rule over other Northland- 
ers and the cities of the coast to be their birthright. 

Merchants can occasionally trade with Rauthym at 
its capital city, also called Ruathym, but I don’t risk 
such a stopover if I can help it. One never knows when 
Ruathym is going to be at war, and any ship within sight 
of the island when it is will be fair prey. 

Tuern 

Well to the west of its nearest neighbor, the remote 
island of Tuern is host to violent folk who raid and 
pillage at will and seek to enslave any outlanders they 
capture on or near their island. They trust no magic of 
any kind, and offer tribute to the red dragons and giants 
that dwell in the high mountain caves of this place. They 
have five kings, with a High King supposedly enthroned 
in their capital of Uttersea, but like any sailor with 
sense, I’ve avoided the island by a great distance, so I 
can’t tell you which bloodthirsty knave currently rules 
the roost. 



The Whalebones 

The tiny outcrops that make up the Whalebones are so 
numerous it’s impossible to accurately chart them all. 
Each has its own legends and its own (often self-pro- 
claimed) king, and they battle one another incessantly 
in skirmishes where the casualties number in the 
dozens, at most. 

The Whalebones are so called because of the scat- 
tered skeletons of those great sea creatures that litter 
the beaches of most of the islands. These bones are the 
only real commodity of worth these isles have— which 
means that anyone thinking to simply sail up and pluck 
ivory from the shores of the Whalebones is sorely 
underestimating how furiously its inhabitants defend 
their property. 

Orlumbor 

If you’re looking to purchase or repair a ship, there is 
no better place to do it along the Sword Coast than 
in Orlumbor. The finest shipwrights in the world live 
here, and their joining work is among the reasons 
Waterdeep remained so strong for so many years. 

Even when much of the city’s navy lay disabled in its 
harbor, the strong ships of Orlumbor proved sturdy 
enough that folk could live on and in them while the 
city recovered. 

Orlumbor was once a simple shipwright island, sup- 
plying the city-states of the Sword Coast with vessels for 
their navies. Waterdeep in particular relied on Orlum- 
bor to supply ships for its defense, making the island a 
wealthy and well-protected place in return. When Lord 
Neverember sank Waterdeep’s navy in his fight against 
pirates, he arranged to hire mercenary ships to replace 
the force, funneling ill-gotten proceeds into his own 
pockets, and leaving both the coffers and the shipyards 
of Orlumbor high and dry. After Neverember’s ouster, 
Waterdeep’s business returned, and with it much of the 
isle’s prosperity. 

Reaching Orlumbor by ship is tricky because of the 
rocky, cavernous approach to the harbor. Once a ship 
navigates the route properly, it can find a wider berth, 
and any minor damage to the new visitor is happily 
(and cheaply) repaired by the Orlumbor dockworkers. 
These are folk born and bred to work on ships. The 
homes on Orlumbor are built into the caverns of the 
island, and just as well defended as the docks that are its 
life’s blood. 

More than once down the years, Waterdeep’s protec- 
tion has kept Orlumbor from falling to Mintarn, Luskan, 
Amn, or Baldur’s Gate, all of which have sought to claim 
the islands and its shipyards for their own. None of 
these other places ever considered that Orlumbor might 
simply choose not to build ships for them, but thank- 
fully, it’s never come to that. Now, Orlumbor once again 
serves Waterdeep, in exchange for coin, foodstuffs, and 
other goods from Faerun. 

Southern Isles 

Off the coast of the southern realms of Faerun, even 
south of the Moonshae Isles, are some smaller, less 
influential island nations. The Nelanther, just across 




Asavir’s Channel from Tethyr, is a land of raiding 
pirates. Farther south, some three hundred miles from 
the Moonshaes, is the fabled island of Lantan, birthplace 
of many odd inventions. Well south of there, beyond the 
jungles of Chult, is the mysterious island of Nimbral. 

Lantan 

I had not visited Lantan for over a year when it hap- 
pened, but the way most tell it, when magic failed utterly 
in this place, all the stored smokepowder and magical 
gewgaws in Lantan exploded, one by one, just as great 
waves washed over the island. Within a terrifyingly 
short time, Lantan was no more. 

Or so the stories of survivors went. It appears now 
that Lantan was transferred to another world, much like 
Halruaa. Halruua, though, had foreseen the calamity 
and taken time to prepare. Lantan was not so lucky. 

The Lantanese were fascinated— some say obsessed— 
with building mechanical wonders. Though they 
employed magic from time to time, the whole island 
smelled like sawdust, grease, and freshly scraped 
metal, as shop after shop worked on refining its latest 
and greatest invention. The new creation might have 
been little metal knights that walk and fight and knock 
each other over, elaborate coffers with locks that latch 
themselves, or mechanical arms that copy what a scribe 
is writing onto a second sheet of parchment. During 
my past visits there, I’d seen all of those and more with 
my own eyes. 

Were these gewgaws and trifles of help to the Lan- 
tanese when the whole world was ripped from under 
them? To whom did they turn when in that other world 
their prayers to their favored god, Gond, went unan- 
swered? What happened in their century away, and 
now that they are returned, are they happy to be here, 
or does it seem like their world has once more been 
ripped away? 

Some ships claiming to be from returned Lantan 
have appeared in ports along the Sword Coast, but from 
what I hear, the Lantanese who emerge from them are 
guarded and say little about their homeland. These 
traders seek to attain large quantities of raw materials 
such as various types of woods and metals, trading 
unusual gems and strange gold coins in return. Of their 
inventions, folks have seen little, but the few glimpses 
attained have fueled much speculation about Lantan’s 
development of smokepowder weapons and greater 
willingness to blend magic with machinery. Indeed, 
Lantanese traders have reportedly offered many shield 
guardians in private auctions up and down the Sword 
Coast, and such golem-like constructs are usually the 
province of wizards, not tinkerers. 

Nelanther 

Take an old salt’s advice and beware the Pirate Isles of 
the Sea of Swords, the Nelanther. Here, all manner of 
seafaring or sea-dwelling creatures live, from lizardfolk 
and minotaurs to ores and ogres, with a smattering of 
humans and others thrown in for variety. Where some 
pirates hold to their own code of conduct, the folk of 
Nelanther care nothing for rules, honor, or even good, 
neighborly sense: they attack each another as often 



Banner of the 
Knights of Nimbral 


and as viciously as they do any passing ship or convoy. 
Simply put, the Nelanther Isles are a chain of reavers 
and raiders, who eke out a living fighting whomever 
they can find. 

No one’s ever bothered to count or name all the tribes 
of these islands, and I doubt anyone’s going to start 
now. For one thing, it’s a fools errand: tribes split up 
or are destroyed at such a rapid pace that by the time 
you finished counting, you’d have to start over anyway. 
For another, it’s dirty, dangerous work, and dealing 
with pirates is a task best left to swift ships, well-armed 
navies, and the kinds of fools that would want to count 
them in the first place. 

If you do find out the name of a tribe in the Nelanther, 
be careful about mentioning it to another Nelanther 
ship unless you can confirm that the ship belongs to 
a friendly tribe. Even so, be advised that alliances are 
short as summer storms in these isles, and it’s not likely 
you’ll be around long enough to witness a new one being 
forged. Proclaiming your allegiance to a certain tribe 
might anger the one you’re talking to. 

Still, if you’re looking for cheap, strong hands, Nelan- 
ther may be the place for you, but don’t expect much in 
the way of loyalty or cleverness out of them. Hiring too 
many Nelanther sailors on a ship is just asking for your 
ship to be taken from you, sailed back to the islands, and 
given new life as a pirate vessel. 

Nimbral 

Ever seen an island simply disappear? That is, sup- 
posedly, what happened to Nimbral at about the time 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 



Lantan drowned, or so they say. Four ship captains of 
my acquaintance claim to have seen it one moment, and 
then not seen it the next, and sailed straight through its 
former location as though it was never there. 

Some claim that powerful magic moved or hid the 
island in a vast illusion. That I find believable, because 
the Lords of Nimbral have long been known for illusion 
and trickery. If any isle were to vanish into thin air, it 
would be theirs. Likewise, Nimbral’s return is certainly 
within their capabilities, and perhaps this event is the 
climax of a trick so long and complex that even a gnome 
can envy its scope. 

Nimbral today is much as it has always been: far-flung 
and secretive. Where the island went, what it did while 
gone, and why it came back all seem to be facts the 
Lords of Nimbral prefer to keep to themselves. 

Nimbral is still ruled by its mysterious lords, a closely 
related family of archmages, master illusionists all. They 
in turn appoint the heralds, who proclaim the laws, and 
the Knights of Nimbral, fabled hippogriff riders clad in 
armor clear as glass but strong as steel. Don’t let the 
fact that they are called knights fool you. The Knights of 
Nimbral have always acted as pirates when out on patrol 
over the seas, preying on ships that strayed close to 
their island. 

What my captain friends were doing in waters so 
close to Nimbral they did not disclose. “Business” was 
all they’d say, but no one has business so far south as 
Nimbral, unless they expect to dock at the island. Alas, 
in the time since we last spoke, all those captains have 
died, and I can’t question them further about what they 
know of the place. 

If you have cause to sail south by Chult, keep a wary 
eye on the skies. It might not help, since the Knight of 
Nimbral have been known to appear out of nowhere, 
apparently invisible before they attacked, but it pays to 
be cautious when you’re doing something foolish. 

Evermeet _ 

What I tell you now is truth as pure as Garl’s nugget, 
and the only reason I’ve written it in a book for all to 
see is that no one else shall ever achieve the feat: I 
stowed away on a ship bound for Evermeet, and my feet 
touched its blessed ground! 

Any who’re knowledgeable about the place might 
scoff at my claim, and those ignorant of it like as not 
think the deed not the feat of legend it was, so let me 
explain to those doubters among you what Evermeet is 
and why, by the end of my tale, you’ll envy my boots. 

A Little Piece of Heaven 

Legend has it— and so believes every elf I’ve ever met— 
that the island of Evermeet is not of this world, and 
that it never was. In ancient days, so long ago that even 
elves think of it as their mythic past, the elves of many 
nations sought a perfect homeland for their people. 
(That was the problem there, of course. You’ll miss out 
on a wealth of beauty it you’re always looking for the 
perfect gem.) Not finding it in the world, some elves 
(sun elves, I’d wager) looked beyond the world to create 
one. These High Mages gathered together to perform 
a mighty work of magic that would bring Toril into 


contact with Arvandor— that’s right, the mad fools actu- 
ally wanted to bring into our world some of the lands in 
which their gods dwelt! 

Tales differ on whether Corellon allowed this or was 
powerless to prevent it, but it happened, and calamity 
gripped Toril as a result. This was the first Sundering, 
and elves have always said it echoed through time. 
Recent calamities would seem to prove them right. 

When things settled down, the elves realized their 
folly. For thousands of years, no elf dared set foot on 
Evermeet. But eventually Corellon must have forgiven 
his wayward children, for the oldest elves began to feel 
the call to the west. 

Perhaps you’ve seen a moonbow hang over Selune 
and heard the idea that it means an elf is being called 
to Evermeet. Well, that is no children’s story. Ever 
met an elderly elf? How would you know, right? Well 
if you’re ever honored to meet an elderly elf at such a 
time, you’ll see a similar arc in each of the elf’s eyes 
above the pupil. This is Sehanine Moonbow’s way of 
guiding the elf to the afterlife. The arcs can blind the 
elf to this world, but they vanish when the elf enters 
the next, allowing sight of the elven heaven. Well that’s 
exactly what happens in Evermeet, and the elf need 
not be dead to achieve it. Don't believe me? Well, I saw 
what I saw. 

Some elves followed their aged kin to Evermeet, and 
soon a kingdom of elves dwelt in a heaven on Toril. For 
ages Evermeet was protected by mighty beasts, mighty 
magic, and the might of the Seldarine themselves. 
Elves of all types from all over the world journeyed to 
Evermeet seeking solace. And when the elves declared 
their Retreat from the world, where do you think 
they went? 

Then the Spellplague struck, and some of that old 
elven High Magic must have unraveled. Evermeet 
became unmoored from the world and found itself 
instead in a sea of the Feywild, that strange realm of 
faerie that touches the world in mystical places. For a 
century, it seemed Evermeet was lost to the world. Ven- 
erable elves tried to hold on, hoping that this echo of 
the first Sundering might echo Evermeet’s connection 
to the world once the period of calamity ended. 

Their patience (who but an elf could have such 
patience?) was at last rewarded, when ships from Ever- 
meet docked once more in Sword Coast ports. 

Sailing to the West 

Knowing all this and having just met a venerable elf 
who was preparing for the journey, how could I not 
take the opportunity to tag along? I felt a little bad 
about taking advantage of the elf’s blindness and forc- 
ing him to leave behind some of his baggage, but it was 
the opportunity of a lifetime! 

I overheard it said by the captain of the ship that 
Evermeet now somehow straddles all three planes: 
our world, the Feywild, and Arvandor. It touches them 
all, but exists fully in none of them. To find it, you must 
follow a pattern of stars until the stars change and then 
follow new stars. (I swear by Garl’s nugget that’s what 
he said!) Those who stray from the path are lost. How 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 


I wish I could have asked the captain where the lost 
ships- went! But I couldn’t give myself away. 

I had brought some food with me, since I didn’t know 
how long I’d have to remain hidden aboard the ship. At 
the start of the journey, I pricked my ears up at every 
creak of the boards and at each elven voice, but after a 
time, lulled by the rocking of the sea, I fell asleep. The 
journey after that has a dreamlike quality. I know I 
must have awoken, eaten, slept, and taken care of other 
necessities— at least my food was all eaten by journey’s 
end— but I don’t recall the specifics. I only know that 
at some point the ship stopped, and someone took 
the basket in which I was hidden and placed it on a 
sandy beach. 

What I Saw 

I felt it before I saw it. With the barest glimmer of 
golden light through the basket weave all that I could 
see, Evermeet took my breath way. Coiled in the basket 
like a snake, with cramps in every limb, I was desper- 
ate not to give myself away, yet I could feel the magic 
of Evermeet seep through my body, soothing aching 
limbs and easing guilty conscience. When I could 
breathe again, I gasped. And that was how the elf dis- 
covered me. 

The blind elf, whose beloved treasures I’d displaced 
to take my journey, pulled me from his basket, and 
when he did so, his eyes were clear as diamonds and 
just as hard. I thought for sure that I was dead, and on 
seeing my surroundings, I can say with all my heart 
that I didn't care. Had the elf killed me on the spot, my 
soul would have gone to Garl and demanded a ship 
so that I could sail right back to Evermeet. My dumb 
wonderment caused the elf to turn and look, and he too 
was enraptured. 

As to what we beheld, well, imagine a place of stag- 
gering natural beauty and impossible elven artifice, an 
alien realm as distant and beautiful as the stars, but as 
much a part of you as your own dreams— part heaven, 
part home. 

I’d like to say we shared a moment there, the elf and 
I. Perhaps in recognition of that, he didn’t kill me. 

It was over all too soon. I was put back on the boat, 
returned to the world, and warned never to try any- 
thing so foolish again— on pain of death. And I don’t 
think I will— at least not until I’m getting up there in 
years. Then I’ll keep my eyes peeled for elves with 
cloudy eyes looking west! 

Now, see? Wouldn’t you have liked to have been a 
gnome’s boots and touched Evermeet, even for just a few 
beats of the heart? 



Independent Realms 

I HAVE WANDERED THESE LANDS FOR LONGER THAN 

you've been alive , caravan master. 1 503; this not to some- 
how lord these years over you, but so that you understand 
that when I say your proposed “ short cut ” leads only to the 
bloody demise of yourself and your work hands, you will 
believe me, because I have seen others make the same as- 
sumption, and die the same deaths. 

— Aedyn Graymantle, 
to Wundrith Parr, Waterdhavian caravan master 

Though there are myriad nations, kingdoms, and 
city-states scattered across the length and breadth of 
Faerun, it would be a dangerous mistake to assume that 
all of the lands in and between those places are tamed. 
Travel a short way beyond most civilized places, and one 
finds oneself in the midst of wilderness haunted by crea- 
tures deadly and foul. 

The information below is excerpted from Far from the 
Misty Hills, a treatise on far-flung places in the North, 
composed by one Aedyn Graymantle, a moon elf ranger 
who hails from Evereska. In her years of braving the 
wilds, Aedyn has acted as guide, caravan guard, body- 
guard, and trailblazer. 

Boareskyr Bridge 

Boareskyr Bridge stands on the Trade Way and is the 
only consistently safe crossing over the Winding Water 
for more than a hundred miles in either direction. This 
alone makes it remarkable, but there, in the midst of a 
wilderness with nothing to set it apart for greatness, a 
mortal man murdered Bhaal, the god of murder. This is 
no tall tale. Even a century after Bhaal’s blood was shed 
there, the river’s waters run black and foul for miles 
west of the bridge. 

Adding to the location’s sacred nature, Cyric, the man 
who killed Bhaal, was himself elevated to godhood. 
Although he proved to be a malign power, statues of 
both Cyric and Bhaal were erected on the ends of the 
bridge, the two gods facing each other (though it is said 
Cyric stabbed Bhaal in the back). About a century ago, 
fanatics of Mystra tore down the statues and flung their 
stones in the river, but fearing retribution for such sac- 
rilege, the merchants who use the bridge pooled funds 
to have them rebuilt in grander style than before. Now 
each god stands atop his own decorated archway that 
serves as entrance to the bridge. 

Boareskyr Bridge is named for a long-ago adventurer 
who built the original bridge and used it as the center 
of a small kingdom, which also bore his name, north 
and east of the Trade Way, though it lasted only a few 
decades before falling to threats from the Fields of the 
Dead. The bridge serves as a connection between the 
lands of the North and the Western Heartlands. 

The enormous black granite bridge is wide enough 
that two wagons can pass one another going opposite 
directions, and its waist-high ramparts are thicker than 
some castle walls. On most days of the summer and 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 


even during seasons less suitable for travel, merchant 
caravans cross the bridge and pilgrims come to pay 
homage, all beneath the protective gaze of the paladins 
of Elturgard stationed at nearby Fort Tamal. 

Fort Tamal 

For many years, a ruined keep on the southern bank 
dubbed Bridgefort served as the campground for cara- 
vans passing over the bridge. Whether going north or 
south, caravan masters could anticipate a safe rest within 
the grassy space enclosed by the ruined walls, sharing 
the duties of keeping watch with other travelers. 

Then in the midst of a crisis of leadership in distant 
Elturel, one of the heirs apparent for the post of High 
Observer, a paladin named Tamal Thent, went missing 
with her entire retinue near the bridge. Although an 
investigation was undertaken, no sign of Tamal or any of 
the others was discovered. Thavus Kreeg, Tamals rival 
for the post, was elevated to the post of High Observer 
soon after, and one of his first declarations was that 
Bridgefort be rebuilt and given a new name in honor of 
lost Tamal. 

A flurry of activity occurred around Boareskyr Bridge 
at that time, with the soldiers of Elturgard making fre- 
quent patrols of the road and surrounding lands while 
Fort Tamal was being constructed. Today things are fairly 
quiet at the bridge. The tradition of caravans camping 
at the bridge and pilgrims visiting it continues, but now 
people stay in a caravan ground around a small village 
that has grown up outside the fort. 

Activity around the area is overseen by a curious mix of 
Companions of Elturgard. The Companions— all paladins 
of gods such as Tyr, Torm, Helm, and Amaunator — tend to 
be either young firebrands or grizzled veterans content to 
sit by a fire. Many of the veterans have been stationed at 
Fort Tamal since it was constructed, and they have fam- 
ilies that live in the village outside its walls. Their more 
youthful counterparts come from all over Elturgard, but 
all seem to have been assigned to Fort Tamal after some 
act of insubordination. Perhaps it is hoped that time out 
on the frontier with their more experienced counterparts 
will cool some of the young Companions’ zeal. 

Certainly some of the young Companions I’ve spoken 
with see their post as a punishment. Boareskyr Bridge is 
far from the rest of Elturgard, and the caravans that camp 
at Fort Tamal never seemed to need such a robust guard 
before. Even the relative nearness of Najara seems to 
provide little reason for so many of Elturgard’s mightiest 
defenders to be squandered on such a trivial task. For 
their part, the elder Companions talk of fulfilling duties 
and following orders, but to me they seemed too content. 

A paladin should have drive. They have been granted 
the power of the gods for a reason, and surely that reason 
can’t be to stand guard while merchants sleep. Then 
again, the High Observer is, by all reports, a wise and 
effective ruler. Perhaps he perceives threats at Boares- 
kyr Bridge that I can't. Najara has been more active of 
late, despite its quiet exterior, I assure you. Dragonspear 
Castle to the north was once again the source of an infer- 
nal incursion. And maybe there is something sinister 
about this place where a god of murder died and a god of 
lies is honored. 


For my part, I sympathize with the young firebrands, 
and I counseled those to whom I spoke to look to the 
skies. In the time of Cyric’s legendary battle with Bhaal, 
pegasi dwelt nearby. The magical creatures are said to 
favor those of pure heart and even allow themselves to 
be ridden by such folk when the cause is just. That favor 
might never be bestowed on the young paladins, but I’m 
sure the thought will provide them with some pleasant 
daydreams. 

Candlekeep 

The great keep never fails to take my breath away: it 
stands on a volcanic crag a hundred or so feet from the 
coastline, a flat-topped spur of rough stone out in the 
midst of the surging sea. Imagine, if you can, the top of 
this crag hemmed in entirely by a tall wall. This wall is 
interrupted by several towers all the way around, and it 
encloses a large space from which even more of these 
same towers rise. Those who have seen this vista from 
above have said that it looks like nothing so much as 
a cake decorated with too many candles. The mist of 
sea-spray fills the air nearest the western walls, and in 
winter, this moisture can cause treacherous build-ups 
of ice. Sometimes entire towers along the western edge 
of the keep have to be abandoned for the season, they 
become so overtaken by frost. 

From the center rises the largest and thickest tower 
of Candlekeep. If the other towers are well-wrought 
branches and blossoms, then this surely is the bole 
of the tree: strong, massive, and rising well above the 
perimeter structures. About the central keep a garden 
spirals in rising steps, and those lucky enough to enter 
the library proper do so by passing around and up 
through this green space to the keep’s main door. How- 
ever, most folk who visit Candlekeep see this structure 
only from the courtyard east of it, where the facilities for 
arriving scholars lie. 

The only gate into Candlekeep stands at the end of 
the Way of the Lion, which is the only road that provides 
access to and from the outside world. The route extends 
from Beregost, leagues away, and winds a lonely path 
out on the peninsula where Candlekeep stands. 

The Great Library 

Candlekeep is the largest repository of lore and writings 
in all the Realms (although my scholarly kin in Evereska 
don’t like being reminded of that). It was once the home 
of the great prophet Alaundo the Seer, and within its 
walls were written the Prophecies of Alaundo. Its vaults, 
it is said, contain hidden knowledge enough to make any 
person with the ability to discover and absorb it all pow- 
erful beyond compare. The problem with doing that, of 
course, is the same as with secrets in any other location: 
one must know that a secret exists before its details can 
be sussed out. 

To that end, Candlekeep’s vast library is something of a 
defense in and of itself: for every bit of hidden lore of poten- 
tially great power that lies within, there are thousands of 
inconsequential recipes, old songs, bits of history, journals 
of long-dead folk, and myriad other pieces of writing of no 
lasting importance save to the monks of this place, and the 
sages who come seeking such trifles. 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 


Of course, before this treasure trove can be plumbed, 
one must gain entry to its hallowed halls. The clois- 
tered scholar-monks of Candlekeep, who are called the 
Avowed, guard this place and work tirelessly to ensure 
the library’s protection and preservation. Though they 
are friendly enough in a workaday fashion, they are also 
suspicious of all visitors to the library. 

Gaining Entrance 

I have assisted more than one visitor with entry into the 
library, so I know the process well. The price of admis- 
sion is the donation of a work of writing not already in 
the possession of Candlekeep. Though the monks refer 
to this offering as the “entrance-gift," it is a toll to be 
paid, and often a quite high one. 

To most, this requirement might seem difficult or even 
impossible to fulfill. After all, how is the would-be visitor 
to know exactly what Candlekeep does and does not 
have in its labyrinthine stacks? To this end, most visitors 
come to Candlekeep with multiple books they suspect 
might meet with approval. 

Fortunately for some, the donation need not be utterly 
unique. Some tome or treatise the library doesn’t have 
in its archives is preferable, but the monks are open to a 
few other possibilities: rare editions, books with a great 
deal of history tied to them, even tomes with insightful 
(or just interesting) notes scribbled in the margins have 
all been accepted, as have the journals of folk who are 
well traveled or highly learned. 

Most of those who come as petitioners to the gates of 
Candlekeep already know the cost of entry; those who 
don’t are told of it at the gates, and turned away kindly 
if they have no such gift. Heralds; priests of the gods 
Oghma, Gond, Deneir, and Milil; certain archmages; 
and others acknowledged as “friends of Candlekeep" 
are permitted to enter without making such a donation 
(though such folk often contribute to the library’s vaults 
as a matter of course anyway). 

The great double gates of Candlekeep are as three 
times the height of a human, and wrought of strange 
black metal that seems to repel lightning and to be 
immune to magical divinations, according to at least one 
wizard I’ve accompanied here. Both of these panels are 
emblazoned with the castle-and-flame sigil of Candle- 
keep in their upper reaches. One of the two gates stands 
open far enough to admit visitors during the day, with 
the other kept shut. 

Five purple-vestmented monks tend this entrance. 

One of them steps forward to greet those seeking admis- 
sion, discussing with new arrivals their intentions and 
examining what gifts they have brought. As the first 
monk examines an offered gift, determining its title and 
provenance, a second gate guard performs a casting of 
the message spell. The Waterdhavian sage Waldrop tells 
me that the recipient of this spell is an Avowed in a room 
nearby with a massive tome that notes the books in 
Candlekeep’s vaults. Apparently aided by magic of some 
kind, that tome-keeper determines if the library has the 
book being offered, and responds concerning whether 
the gift is accepted or not. 

One of the priests of Deneir whom I regularly accom- 
pany to Candlekeep has mentioned truth-seeking 








magics being at work on this threshold. The door- 
guard’s fellows watch closely for any trouble, and other 
monks peer from the high towers that flank the gates, 
ready to summon help or lend magical support in case 
of attack. 

Those who are admitted are referred to as “seeker," 
but also addressed by name if the monk knows it, or 
by “goodsir" or “goodlady" otherwise. Once a visitor is 
admitted, the monks at the gate part ranks to allow the 
seeker inside to the Court of Air. Visitors are instructed 
to cross that area and stand before the Emerald Door, 
where another monk receives them, offers them food, 
bath, and sleeping quarters, and arranges for each to 
meet a monk who will help to plan and then supervise 
the seeker’s visit to the library. 

The Court of Air 

The Court of Air is aptly named. This cobbled courtyard 
is empty, containing neither tree nor well. Its southern 
wall is the southern wall of Candlekeep itself, with a 
number of fieldstone-wrought buildings intended for 
visitors’ use built along it. Nearest the western wall of 
the courtyard stand two buildings: the House of the 
Binder, a large temple of Oghma with plenty of space to 
allow his faithful to camp and socialize, and the Baths, a 
public facility that draws water from the natural spring 
beneath the keep. 

On the other side of the baths is the Hearth, a great 
eating-place and social hall for seekers, which has 
shrines to Deneir, Gond, and Milil built into it. The 
Hearth connects to the House of Rest, a structure with 
four-bunk rooms where seekers are assigned quar- 
ters upon their acceptance. Finally, next to the House 
of Rest, and built up against the eastern wall of the 
courtyard, are the stables, where mounts are housed 
and provisioned for the length of a seeker’s stay, and 
the granary. 

The northern edge of the Court of Air is made up of 
a wall into which are set twelve towers. These are the 
towers within which visitors are allowed to study. 

The famous Emerald Door stands in the western wall. 
Here a Keeper of the Emerald Door stands at all times, 
assisted by a small group of under-monks who act as 
messengers and runners. It is the Keeper who officially 
welcomes newly arrived seekers, and makes arrange- 
ments for their stay. Only this door leads deeper into 
the inner ward; the other towers have entrances onto 
the Court of Air, but don’t have points of egress into the 
inner ward and thus the rest of the library. 

These court-facing towers in the north wall, called 
the “necessariums" by the monks, are the main places 
in which visitors interact with the treasures of Candle- 
keep. They are honeycombed with reading rooms and 
small gathering chambers, where monks may bring 
individual tomes to seekers to be read, and where seek- 
ers may consult with monks on further materials to 
enable their research. Despite being adjacent to other 
towers and having bridges to more distant ones, the 
chambers that guests can reach in the necessariums 
don’t allow access to the rest of the keep. 


Within the Keep 

Unfortunately, the foregoing is the extent of the infor- 
mation I have about the interior of Candlekeep. My 
personal experience is limited (as is the case with most 
visitors) to the Court of Air. Though the stories fly fast 
and thick in the Hearth about what lies beyond the nec- 
essariums, it is almost all conjecture and hearsay, with 
a heavy dose of fable, you can wager safely. 

From the Court of Air, one can see that the tall towers 
that rise up above the northern court wall are intercon- 
nected by covered walkways. Many of these are roofed, 
but not walled, and monks— some of them under quite 
prodigious burdens of books— scramble to and fro along 
them. The passages are sometimes interrupted by small 
spiral staircases that provide access to higher and lower 
levels, and some of the larger walkways slope gently 
from one floor in a given tower to the different level 
in another. 

The only other fact I know about Candlekeep’s interior 
is that it extends even beneath the level of the court- 
yards, with staircases in the cellars of certain of the 
towers that lead down into the very bedrock of the pillar 
upon which the keep is built. A monk once confided to 
me that these caverns store emergency supplies and 
provide access to great wells, all of which would enable 
the great fortification to survive entire seasons— if not 
years— of siege. 

The Avowed 

The monks of Candlekeep are all cloistered scholars. 
Most of them have no magical power to speak of (though 
many of them are trained to know about such things); a 
notable handful, though, are spellcasters either cler- 
ics of gods that represent the pursuit of knowledge or 
wizards. Even warrior-monks and paladins have been 
known among the Avowed, though never many at once. 

The Avowed are the sworn servants of the great 
keep, each rigorously tested to weed out any deceit 
before being permitted to take the oaths of the order. 

The monks* first priority is the defense of the library’s 
knowledge against those who would steal or destroy it, 
but also against natural effects that might do likewise, 
such as mold, wet, and decay. Many of the monks wield 
various kinds of magic items to aid in these endeavors, 
and Candlekeep’s facilities include more than a few 
scriptoria to facilitate the copying of books becoming 
worn, binderies to repair the same, and even magical 
storage that preserve rare books from any further decay 
or damage. 

I've never made a detailed study of the Avowed, as it’s 
never been terribly needful for me to do so, but from my 
time spent in Candlekeep’s Court of Air, as well as my 
conversations with Waldrop, I’ve picked up a few things. 

The rank-and-file of the Avowed are divided into aco- 
lytes, who are newcomers to the order, and scribes, who 
tend to the majority of the work in the keep. Acolytes 
provide labor, doing the cleaning, lifting, and general 
sweating that a place of such size requires, and work 
at their studies, hoping to prove themselves and be 
accepted into the ranks of the scribes. The scribes do 
most of the archival labor required of the Avowed, and 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 


often pitch in with hands-on efforts when a particularly 
large chore needs doing. 

The master readers are the sages and elder monks 
who oversee the scribes and teach the acolytes. All 
are possessed of significant experience and dedicated 
to the great library, and it is from this group that indi- 
viduals are chosen to fill in the upper ranks when 
positions open up. 

Above the master readers are other high-ranking 
posts, each with specialized duty, from the Gatewarden 
who tends to the security of the keep to the Guide who 
instructs and educates the Avowed. Of particular note 
is the Chanter, who is responsible for continuing the 
ongoing recitation of the prophecies of the great seer 
Alaundo, who once made his home here. 

I remember the first time I came upon the Endless 
Chant. It starts at the edge of one’s hearing (I was one of 
the first in the courtyard to sense it), and slowly grows 
closer and louder. As it does so, everything else falls 
silent around you. In short order, a procession of Avowed 
arrive on the scene, and the only sound anyone can per- 
ceive is their echoing, sonorous chant. The Chanter or 
one of his subordinates (called “voices”) leads this proces- 
sion, and each of the Avowed is expected to lend his voice 
to the procession occasionally. 

It was through my friendship with Waldrop that I 
met one of the eight Great Readers, the council of elder 
Avowed who oversee the operation of Candlekeep. She 
was tall, and I remember thinking that she was one of 
the most erudite folk I’d ever spoken with. Each of the 
Great Readers is given an arena of responsibility within 
the Avowed, usually a topic of scholarly importance, and 
acknowledged and treated as the foremost expert in 
that field. 

Finally, above them all are two others: the Keeper of 
Tomes and the First Reader. Where the First Reader’s 
focus is maintaining the integrity of Candlekeep’s schol- 
arship, and ever expanding its literary resources and 
base of knowledge, the Keeper governs the great library. 
The Keeper’s word is law, quite literally— each Keeper’s 
edicts are recorded for the edification of future Keep- 
ers, and all are maintained as ongoing traditions until 
changed by the word of a future Keeper. Waldrop tells 
me that traditionally the Keeper and the First Reader 
are supposed to have an antagonistic relationship, one 
focused on the cloistered monks and the enlightened 
goals of the library and the other on the mundane 
aspects of scholarship and Candlekeep’s interactions 
with the outside world. 

Although these high-ranking monks keep most vis- 
itors at arm’s length, it isn’t unknown for them to deal 
with adventurers directly when they need such services. 
While these scholars rarely have much coin to pay for 
the services of a company of venturers, they do possess 
the precious currency of Candlekeep: knowledge. I 
know of many companies who have been shown lore 
concerning lost ruins, then asked to brave some danger- 
ous place and return with prizes that can be found only 
in that location. If the treasure that might be found in 
such places isn’t enough of a reward, some Avowed are 
empowered to offer inducements such as procedures for 


creating magic items and written copies of rare spells to 
sweeten the deal. 

Services 

Those who come to Candlekeep are permitted to remain 
for one tenday before departing, and must remain away 
for at least a full month before returning. During this 
tenday, they may ask to read specific tomes known to 
be in the possession of the library, or they may ask the 
monks to find them tomes concerning certain topics. 
These works are brought to the reading rooms in the 
towers that face the Court of Air. Guests are permitted 
to ascend into those towers and read (but not copy) the 
tomes there, always in the company of one of the monks. 

One of Candlekeep’s main sources of income is the 
sale of books. Three kinds of such books exist: copies 
of tomes of nonmagical lore, copies of spellbooks and 
other magical formulae, and works of the Avowed. 

Copied Lore. The copying and binding of a work of 
nonmagical lore in Candlekeep’s library is generally 
performed at a cost of 100 gp or so (though quite large 
books are always more). This manufacture may take 
several weeks, particularly for large tomes, so it isn’t 
uncommon for those who desire such a work to commis- 
sion it in writing, along with advance payment, and then 
come to the gate to pick up the book, or pay an addi- 
tional price to have it delivered. 

Spellbooks. In contrast, magical books of spells and 
formulae cost much, much more— a spellbook might be 
priced at thousands or even tens of thousands of gold 
pieces. Each simple spell or cantrip in such a tome costs 
25 gp or so, with the more complex and powerful spells 
fetching 150 gp or more each. 

Works of the Avowed. Each year, the monks of Can- 
dlekeep release a small book stamped with the sigil of 
the keep, and credited to “The Avowed of Candlekeep.” 
These books are always focused on singular topics, 
and contain short essays, excerpts, and other writings 
germane to the topic. They are sold at Candlekeep and 
by representatives in large cities for between 50 gp and 
100 gp per book, though some are often resold for a 
great deal more. 

Candlekeep also buys books and even sponsors 
adventurers on expeditions to seek out lost sources of 
lore across the Realms. The exchange of coin in such 
undertakings is, of course, open to the usual sort of 
negotiation. 

Darkhold 

I don’t suppose you’ve heard of Darkhold. It’s been 
many years since folk whispered the name of the place 
in fear. After all, the Zhentarim, the organization that 
gave Darkhold its evil reputation, are by all accounts no 
longer the cadre of thieves, assassins, and evil wizards 
they once were. And strangely enough, according to my 
source among the Zhentarim, that change in character 
can be traced right back to Darkhold. As it was told to 
me, it came about like this ... 

Zhentil Keep was burning. The Citadel of the Ravens 
lay in ruins. The leadership of the Zhentarim died, were 
captured by the Shadovar of returned Netheril, or were 
in flight. The vaunted Black Network was shredded.

Cells of Zhentarim agents were cut loose, and without 
connections or direction, they dissolved or were crushed 
by rivals. The Zhentarim was no more. 

Or so it seemed. There was one stronghold of the 
Zhents that had not fallen and whose leader never 
wavered in his dedication to the organization. Darkhold 
stands deep in the mountains of the Western Heart- 
lands, and there the remnants of the Zhentarim quietly 
gathered. There they swore allegiance anew to the 
leader who promised to reforge the organization into 
something stronger than before. 

The man to whom this new Zhentarim owed fealty 
was a dark knight known only as the Pereghost. The 
Pereghost had long led the armed forces of the Zhen- 
tarim at Darkhold, and his vision for the revival of the 
organization was along military lines. After a time of 
recruitment and training, the Zhentarim emerged from 
Darkhold not as conquerers or as bullying capitalists 
but as mercenaries willing to serve others instead of 
forcing them to serve. 

In the years that followed, the transformation served 
the Zhentarim well. They earned a reputation for ster- 
ling service, and their ranks swelled. Those who knew 
of Darkhold thought of it as the headquarters of this new 
version of the Zhentarim. 

Membership in the Zhentarim is difficult to assess, 
but my source told me they might have greater num- 
bers now than before their organizations fall. New 
leadership for this larger group has led to a shift in 
focus. While still a source of capable mercenaries, the 
Zhentarim have diversified into mercantile pursuits. 
Zhent guards now ride alongside caravans of their own. 
And whereas a military organization served it well in 
the chaotic period after its fall, my source frequently 
described the Zhentarim as a “family” and leaders as 
“my good friend.” 

My source also spoke in awed tones of the Pereghost, 
as though that figure were still alive and a leader of 
Darkhold. The Pereghost is never seen without his full 
armor and a face-covering helm. If it isn’t an elf behind 
the mask, then I suspect a series of humans might have 
masqueraded as the Pereghost during the past century. 


Darkhold Vale 

I was curious about my source’s tale, and so when I 
had cause to be in the region, I made my way toward 
Darkhold. An enormous mountain peak called the Gray 
Watcher of the Morning looms behind Darkhold to the 
east, casting a great shadow over the keep from sunrise 
until nearly midday. Darkhold sits in a cleft in the side 
of the Gray Watcher, the highest point of permanent 
occupation in a relatively flat and defensible valley called 
Darkhold Vale. 

Darkhold Vale contains a small settlement of the 
same name, consisting mostly of shepherds who tend 
their flocks in the high meadows of the Sunset Moun- 
tains, and a few farmers who coax fine crops from the 
soils that cling to the vale’s fields. The settlement’s main 
source of prosperity is the black stone quarry at the 
southeastern edge of the vale; the heavy carts groan- 
ing with slabs of stone for sale and the large, muscled 
workhorses that pull them are common sights here. 

The common folk of Darkhold Vale tend to be surly 
and suspicious of outsiders, though they are careful to 
avoid offense. 

This settlement of about a hundred or so is utterly 
under the dominion of Darkhold and has seen some 
benefit from the situation: the vale folk see a great deal 
more traffic and trade than the little hamlet would ever 
expect otherwise. Until recently, all the caravans bound 
for Darkhold could seek sanctuary only in the shadow of 
the keep itself. Now the people of the vale have recently 
built both an inn, called the Wyvern’s Rest, and a sepa- 
rate tavern, called the Rookery. 

Some of the locals send to market bales of the thick, 
rich wool they shear from their sheep. Others make a 
living hawking the dandelion wine that Darkhold Vale 
has always produced, but only recently begun to sell 
abroad. The vale has a small militia, technically under 
the command of the Pereghost, but which answers to a 
local captain named Sulvarn. 

To those who’ve come into conflict with the Zhen- 
tarim, living in a place so firmly in their power seems 
unthinkable, but the reality is that life is sedate here. 
Certainly, the soldiers in the castle aren’t to be trifled 
with, but they hardly ever engage in the acts of petty cru- 
elty that one expects from warriors serving a local lord. 
Those who misunderstand the Zhentarim often do so 
because they imagine them to be cackling villains in the 
vein of the Zhents of yore. In reality, they are pragmatic, 
willing to do whatever necessary to achieve their ends. 
But they have no need to terrorize the folk of Darkhold 
Vale, for one simple reason: they already control them. 

In years past, these folk lived in fear and suspicion, 
with a hearty helping of racial prejudice; my first visit to 
Darkhold nearly a century ago was occasion for me to 
hear some of the vilest epithets attached to my kind that 
I’ve ever heard— even worse than those that fall from the 
foul lips of ore raiders in the North. The attitudes of the 
vale folk have changed over the years, however, no doubt 
due in part to the orders of the Pereghost when he reen- 
gaged the Zhentarim with the wider world. 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 



Darkhold Castle 

When l first beheld the great black walls of Darkhold, 

I thought all the legends about it must be true. On my 
second visit, I thought I’d try to confirm my suspicions. 

According to legend, Darkhold’s story began more 
then a millennium ago, when it was known as the Keep 
of the Far Hills. It was built as a summer capitol for the 
so-called “giant empires.” Situated in the Far Hills, the 
castle was in a position to dominate trade routes north 
out of the Iriaebor Valley. It could also dominate river 
trade down the Yellow Snake Gorge. 

The role of the so-called Giant Emperors is still a 
matter of conjecture and discussion today. However, 
there are some, scattered among the giant tribes of the 
North, who claim to be heirs to the ancient thrones. 
Whatever the truth of the empires might be, the castle 
itself was definitely built for giants. Its size and con- 
struction support no other explanation. 

Legend has it that Darkhold was lost to the giants 
due to internal strife— a pair of brothers quarreling over 
their inheritance. Through poison, magic, and merce- 
naries, the brothers thinned the castle’s population until 
only the brothers themselves were left. The two fought 
and mortally wounded each other, and each dragged 
himself off to die alone. The brothers’ spirits are still 
said to stalk the castle, each still seeking his brother’s 
destruction. 

The keep was then occupied by a succession of 
owners, including a dragon of some repute, but it was 
not until a lich claimed it that the castle came to be 
known as Darkhold. The lich was called Varalla, and 
supposedly she conjured all manner of evil creatures 
to serve her, sending them out to dominate the lands 
beyond and establish an empire of evil. Varalla ruled 
Darkhold until the infamous leaders of the old Zhen- 
tarim— Manshoon and Fzoul— heard tales of her wealth 
in magic and gold. Lured by the promise of such rich 
rewards, the pair defeated her and claimed the castle for 
themselves. 

Upon my arrival at the great gates to the fortress, I 
found that I was expected, as I must have been watched 
since entering Darkhold Vale— perhaps even before 
then. After a short wait, I was met by a seneschal, a 
forthright woman with a strong handshake, who warmly 
referred to the person who secretly supplied me with the 
history of the Zhentarim. I found myself taken aback by 
this because I had thought my source and I had spoken 
in confidence. As you no doubt have noticed, I’ve avoided 
mentioning the name, gender, or physical description of 
my source, for I swore an oath of secrecy. Besides my 
initial shock, my exchange with the seneschal was pleas- 
ant, and I was given a tour of some of the mighty castle. 

When I asked about the legends of Darkhold's cre- 
ation and occupation, she told much the same story as I 
have told, adding a few characters from its history that I 
hadn’t heard of before. When asked about castle haunt- 
ings, the seneschal only smiled in reply. Although it 
seemed a genuine smile, I could wring no truth from it. 

Of the castle’s defenses, I can say little. My tour was 
limited. But I did note that, while some things on the 
giants’ scale have been modified to suit humans (such as 
stairs and most doors), other things remain titanic. For 




instance, I have no idea how they managed to open the 
gates for my entrance without the use of magic. 

Denizens of Darkhold 

I didn't see the Pereghost during my visit, so I can’t 
confirm anything about the man. But the seneschal 
and everyone else with whom I conversed spoke of 
the Pereghost in awed tones. Whatever the truth of 
this savior of the Zhentarim, he is apparently too busy 
to entertain curious visitors. While at Darkhold, I 
heard the name of another leader of some importance, 
Manxam, but my queries about this figure were redi- 
rected to other topics, and I didn’t feel comfortable 
pressing the seneschal on the matter. 

Of the rest of Darkhold I can relate only a little more. 
The Zhentarim maintain two war units within Dark- 
hold: the Storm Watch, a cadre of veteran Zhentarim 
soldiers who act as heavy infantry, and the Gray Feath- 
ers, archers primarily responsible for the defense of 
the fortress. 

These aren't the only forces Darkhold can bring to 
bear, however. The years when a contingent of giants 
lived in Darkhold are long gone, but in their place is an 
aerie of wyverns, bred and trained to defend Darkhold 
and to obey the Pereghost. Their trainer is a ranger 
named Grigarr, whose body is pocked with myriad scars 
from wyvern stings. The man is a greedy wretch who 
claims he is now immune to the wyverns’ venom, after 
having been stung so many times. He loves telling sto- 
ries in the Rookery about how he got his many stings, 
and thinks himself an entertaining storyteller because 
people listen and applaud. The truth is that the locals 
are terrified of him, so they humor him while he is 
in his cups. 

Elturgard 

Ah Elturgard! If any place in the world exemplifies 
humanity’s potential for greatness, it is this nascent 
nation. Who could forget the shining sight of a host of 
its Companions, paladins all, riding out on the field, 
banners taught and snapping, breastplates and shields 
agleam with the symbol of Elturgard, and each bearing 
a holy symbol of his or her god— armor for the soul. We 
have no shortage of the good and the just among my 
people, but the sheer zeal and genuine bravado the Com- 
panions have in pursuit of righteousness seems to me 
something uniquely human. And it's not just those few 
touched by the gods who seek these high ideals; Eltur- 
gard’s armed forces swell with men and women who 
aspire to join the Companions. They are the Hellriders, 
so named because long ago warriors of Elturel literally 
rode through a gate into the Nine Hells to pursue and 
destroy devils that had been plaguing their people. With 
these bright examples to look up to, is it any wonder that 
the common people of Elturgard also tend to be devout 
in their pursuit of justice and worship of the gods? 

Oh how bright Elturgard’s light burns! If only it could 
last. Humans are, after all, short-lived creatures, and 
fickle in their faith and attentions. Elturgard is the prod- 
uct of just a generation or two of humans, and it seems 
implausible that it will last many more. Sadly, I think I 
shall witness Elturgard diminish. But it was a miracle 

CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 


79 


- .V* 


mmmmm 




The Crest 
of Elturgard 


that brought about the nation of Elturgard, and perhaps 
that divine provenance will preserve it. 

It began, as all the great stories do, in darkness. Half a 
century ago, the city of Elturel was a petty power. It had 
claimed its neighbors’ territory under various excuses, 
putting them under “Elturel’s Guard.” Then, the city’s 
leader, its High Rider, was revealed to be a vampire. The 
extent of the vampire’s network of charmed servants, 
undead allies, and willing sycophants took the Hellrid- 
ers by surprise. An undead plague swamped Elturel, 
and although its Hellriders made some gains by day, 
in darkness the vampire and its minions inflicted cruel 
losses. Each night the good people of Elturel prayed to 
the gods that dawn might come more swiftly. 

Then, on a particularly disastrous night when all 
seemed lost, dawn did come. A warm golden light 
suffused the city and surrounding lands, cast down 
from a golden orb that hung unwavering in the sky, so 
bright that it seemed a new day had dawned. Caught 
outside when this miracle appeared, the High Rider 
and his vampire spawn burned away to dust, and the 
other undead quailed in its illumination. In short order, 
Elturel was free. 

When the true dawn came, the new sun remained. 

And it stayed in the sky through the next night, and the 
night after, and each night from then until now. While 
some called it Amaunator’s Gift, none could say what 
god granted them this boon. Most saw it as a companion 
to the sun and to themselves, and so it is known as the 
Companion. This holy wonder brought pilgrims of all 
kinds to Elturel. The devout, the curious, the afflicted- 
all came to bathe in its warmth and see its blessed light 


by night. Paladins had always been small in number 
among the Hellriders, but the Companion drew many to 
Elturgard, and the best among them was named High 
Observer to rule in the High Rider’s place. 

To maintain order among the many faiths of the pal- 
adins, a special knighthood was created, named after 
the Companion sun. These paladins swore to uphold the 
Creed Resolute, an oath of service to Elturgard and all 
good people. And thus Elturgard now has both the Com- 
panions and the Hellriders. 

The post of High Observer is no longer occupied by a 
paladin, but by a priest of Torm named Thavus Kreeg, 
and this to me seems fitting. Paladins should be out in 
the world, using their divine gifts for the good of all, 
not signing documents behind some desk or dithering 
with dignitaries. High Observer Kreeg has ruled wisely 
and well these past forty years or so, but as a short- 
lived human, he is nearing the end of his years. When 
he passes or can no longer cope with the demands of 
his office, I hope that Elturgard can make a smooth 
transition to equally strong leadership. It is during such 
change and the struggles for power that result that 
humans often stray from the righteous path. Perhaps 
the light of the Companion will show them the way. 

Elturel’s Guard 

Sometimes called the Kingdom of Two Suns, Elturgard 
encompasses Elturel, Triel, Scornubel, Soubar, and 
Berdusk. It also claims and protects many small villages 
and farms strung along the roads and rivers in the West- 
ern Heartlands. 

The heraldry of Elturgard— the sun and a smaller com- 
panion sun surrounded in a blaze— is familiar to many 
of us along the roads that lead to and through Elturgard, 
for it also blazons the armor and flags of its two groups 
of guardians, the Hellriders and the Companions. 

It might be fairly said that the only reason Elturgard 
can exist as a nation is because of these knights, for it 
faces threats from all around. The wilderness to the 
south is home to ravenous monsters, and the serpent 
kingdom of Najara to the north routinely sends agents— 
both raiders and spies— to test the strength of Elturgard. 
The knights can’t afford to be anything but vigilant, and 
fortunately for the folk of Elturgard, they are just that. 

I regard crossing the border into Elturgard as a relief, 
for it usually means the beginning of a safe haven, with 
a need to set fewer guards at night. Many adventurers 
find good cause to visit Elturgard, whether pursuing 
personal goals or seeking sanctuary from the dangers 
that surround the small nation. Additionally, the High 


Fort Morninglord 

Several years ago, the entire complement of paladins at 
Fort Morninglord simply disappeared. The High Observer 
at the time ordered the fort, a day's ride west of Elturel, 
to be bricked up, and the curious forbidden entrance, for 
fear of what evil they might release into the world. The fort 
remains sealed today, and guards occupy a fortified en- 
campment nearby. The camp serves as a base from which 
the paladins of Elturgard can patrol this area of the nation, 
and also as a deterrent to adventurers and other ne’er-do- 
wells who might otherwise try to find whatever is trapped 
in the fort’s depths. 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 


Observer is known to employ groups of adventurers in 
matters of importance to the nation. Though it has many 
paladins and clerics in its ranks, outside assistance is 
essential to the continued defense of the realm. 

The Companion 

The second sun that sits directly above Elturel burns 
night and day. This orb is commonly called the Compan- 
ion, but some ascribe it to one deity or another. Where 
the natural sun journeys across the sky and disappears 
at night, the Companion is steady and loyal, ever pre- 
venting creatures of darkness from assaulting the city. 

This second sun provides daytime illumination to the 
people of Elturel at all hours, and its illumination is as 
harmful to creatures vulnerable to sunlight as the sun 

is. This constant daylight lessens the farther one travels 
from Elturel, casting a sort of wan dawn light for fifty or 
so miles around the city. Beyond that, the orb is visible 
as a bright beacon in the sky. It can be seen clearly at 
night from as far away as Boareskyr Bridge and Ber- 
dusk, looking like an unmoving star low on the horizon. 
It might be fairly said that every land touched by its light 
is now under “Elturel’s Shield,” but such claims raise 
hackles among Elturgard’s neighbors. 

The Creed Resolute 

With no clear sign of the source of the Companion and 
so many faithful arriving in Elturgard each day, the first 
High Observer brought together a cadre of paladins and 
devised the Creed Resolute. This series of oaths and 
maxims outlines, among other things, that those who 
swear by it will not ascribe the Companion to any one 
god, nor allow religious differences to come between 
themselves and others. Those who swear the Creed 
Resolute also promise to serve the High Observer and 
uphold the laws of Elturgard, and always be in service 
to the greater good. While originally the Creed Resolute 
was intended to forge the fractious paladins of Elturgard 
into the Companions, the oath has since been taken by 
all among the Hellriders as well. If a Hellrider or Com- 
panion oversteps the bounds of the law or good conduct, 
often a fellow will say “recall the Creed,” and soon 
things are set right. 

Though some of the Creeds agents seem unnecessar- 
ily stern, the people of Elturgard hold the Hellriders and 
Companions in the highest esteem. The Companions 
are without a doubt the champions of the people first 
and foremost, and the folk of Elturgard love them for 

it. Though it might be hard to get the Companions to 
crack a smile, IVe found even the lowliest of the guards 
here willing, without a second thought, to lay down their 
lives in defense of their people, and the folk of Elturgard 
know it. Disrespect the Creed, and it isn’t the Creed’s 
wrath you face, but that of the local citizenry. 

Elturel 

Elturel is a city on a hill. It stands overlooking the River 
Chionthar, constantly illuminated by the Companion. 

A major location along the trade route through the 
Western Heartlands, Elturel and its environs for many 
miles around are a safe haven for visitors and citizens 
alike. Much of this safety comes from the efforts of the 


Hellriders, whose cavalry patrol the roads that lead into 
Elturgard, as well as the paths along the river. 

In the city’s center, directly beneath the Companion, is 
a cliff-sided tor that holds aloft the High Hall. This castle, 
whose walls surround the summit of the mount, is home 
to the High Observer, and to a great deal of the bureau- 
cracy of Elturgard. A stream runs out of the center of the 
castle, spawned by the powerful springs in its cellars. It 
flows north across the tor’s top and then down one of its 
cliffs in a series of waterfalls called the Maidens’ Leap. 

By canal it forms a moat for the eastern Dock District, 
before it joins the Chionthar. Along the stream across the 
tor lies the long, narrow garden, an open place of flowers, 
wooded paths, and arched bridges. The garden is a favor- 
ite meeting place for citizens of Elturel and retains a wild 
beauty in winter. The rich folk of the city dwell nearest 
the garden atop the tor, while folk in the town below live 
mostly in tall, narrow homes that are rich in balconies 
and windows. 

Its benefits notwithstanding, the constant illumina- 
tion that bathes Elturel can be difficult for newcomers 
to adjust to. Inns and boarding halls usually swathe the 
windows of their guest rooms in thick cloth to block out 
the light so that visitors can get some sleep. Without 
the onset of dawn or dusk to frame the day’s labors, cit- 
izens rely on the tolling of the bells from the High Hall 
to denote the start and end of the workday. The lack of 
natural darkness means the city sees less of the sorts of 
activities that city folk in other places often undertake 
at night. Elturel has a low incidence of brawling and 
ambushes in the alleys around its inns and taverns, and 
those who would engage in thievery must be especially 
careful and shrewd to succeed. 

Other Communities 

A few other major settlements of note are located within 
the borders of Elturgard. I describe three of them 
briefly here. 

Berdusk. A large population of artisans drives the 
activity in the city of Berdusk. Its native nobility, the 
so-called “First Folk of Berdusk.” have made a great 
show of their piety since the founding of Elturgard, and 
a great many of the high-ranking priests hail from their 
families. Over the years a few bad apples in their midst 
have given Berduskans a reputation for the sin of “false 
piety”— pretending to a stronger faith than one actually 
possesses. Though this attitude is disapproved of by the 
Creed, it has given rise in other parts of Elturgard to the 
expression “as holy as a Berduskan priest”— which is to 
say, not very. 

Scornubel. Known far and wide as the City of Car- 
avans, Scornubel is the great trading nexus of the 
Kingdom of Two Suns, and the Elturgard city I am most 
familiar with. Though responsible for a great deal of the 
nation’s prosperity, it is also the source of plenty of its 
trouble; Scornubel is a haven for outlanders, many of 
whom are either troublemakers or folk whom trouble is 
pursuing. Add to this the machinations of Scornubel’s 
native merchant-princes and the rumors of a thieves’ 
guild somewhere in its walls, and it can be understood 
why the saying “The High Observer’s headache is 
named Scornubel” has some merit. 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 




Soubar. Soubar is a small walled town with support- 
ing farmsteads strung along the road to the north and 
south. It is a waypoint settlement much like any other 
except for the existence of the Black Abbey. This dark 
stone structure once served as a monastery to Bane and 
lay in ruins for many years. Now priests of Bane have 
begun rebuilding it, bringing an influx of wealth and 
trade, along with the many skilled masons and laborers 
necessary for such a project. Some people question the 
desirability of a temple to Bane in Elturgard, but those 
who do are encouraged to recall the Creed. For their 
part, the priests of Bane have pledged to aid in Soubar’s 
defense against raiding goblinoids and other threats, a 
promise that gives some solace to the suspicious. 

Evereska 

I would be remiss if I didn’t mention Evereska, but I will 
be brief for I have no desire to publish all its secrets. I 
shall endeavor to describe my own homeland in as unbi- 
ased a way as I might, but I must warn: I am a daughter 
of the Greycloak Hills, and its mists yet roil through my 
soul as surely as elven blood does through my veins. Ere 
I make mention of my home, though, I will discuss the 
meeting-ground that is the closest most outsiders will 
ever get to fair Evereska: the Halfway Inn. 

The Halfway Inn 

Evereska lies hidden in the Greycloaks. Our paths to 
it are secret, cloaked by natural features and magical 
guise. No significant human settlement stands within a 
hundred miles west of it, and to the east lies the hungry 
desert sands of Anauroch. 

Strange, then, that the Halfway Inn should stand 
where it does. Perhaps it is there because, as humans 
put it, “It is halfway to everywhere.” A small village 
surrounds the titular inn, which is itself not a single 
building, but a small compound that includes stables 
and other outbuildings. The folk who live here year- 
round are hunters, trappers, gold prospectors, gem 
seekers, smallholders and their families, and it is they 
who staff the inn when traders come to see what goods 
can be reaped from the region. 

Evereska is self-sufficient, but its citizens in their trav- 
els sometimes stop at the Halfway Inn and, if traders 


are present, exchange goods with them. Whenever I 
return home, I make it a point to spend at least a night 
at the inn to see old friends (often much older since last I 
saw them) and learn what has passed since my last visit. 

Elf artisans sometimes come out of the Greycloak 
Hills to sell their goods here, and some of the best- 
known can sometimes spark impromptu bidding wars 
over the right to purchase their wares. My kin don’t do 
anything so pedestrian as set up booths or tables for 
themselves, but instead deal with a few traders who 
might be at the inn at the time. These agents then travel 
out and sell the elven crafts to others, which has given 
the Halfway Inn an undeserved reputation as Evereska’s 
trading post. 

Permit me to state this in as clear a fashion as writ- 
ing allows: don’t venture into the mountains seeking 
Evereska unless you are in the company of a citizen of 
Evereska. You will not find such accompaniment easily, 
for we are determined over the whole of our lives that 
no outsiders may gaze upon our homes without invi- 
tation from the eldest among us. If strangers need to 
meet with any of us, that is the purpose the Halfway 
Inn fulfills. 

The Refuge in the Hills 

When I rest at the end of the day and retreat into reverie, 
I do not revisit the wonders of ancient ruins and majes- 
tic creatures I have seen on my wanderings. At those 
times, I recall the Evereska I wandered as a youth, when 
I followed a haunting song or a wisp of light among the 
roiling fogs of the Greycloaks, picked sweet berries in 
the hollows of the hills, and swam in the cold streams 
that flowed out of their heights. 

Evereska nestles in a sunny canyon, high in the 
mountains. The surrounding peaks hide it from all but 
the most powerful fliers who can stand the chill and 
high winds of their towering heights. Yet should such 
approach Evereska, its guardians mounted on giant 
eagles would ensure no ill befell the vale. 

Unlike cramped and crowded human cities, Evereska 
is composed of clusters of buildings throughout the 
many levels of the great valley, with many a footpath 
between them. These clusters are separated by clear- 
ings, meadows, and small woodland groves— natural 
spaces just as much a part of the city as the buildings 
are, their presence essential to our way of life. 

With the recent tragedy of Myth Drannor’s second fall, 
Evereska has seen the largest influx of new citizens in 
many centuries, in the form of our Cormanthan breth- 
ren. They have been warmly welcomed into Evereska, 
but some of our people are concerned that so many new 
residents will disrupt the peace and balance we’ve thus 
far been able to maintain. At the same time, some of 
the newcomers have reacted unpleasantly to Evereska’s 
reclusiveness, which they see as a form of prejudice or 
cowardice, and a few of their younger folk have taken 
it upon themselves to speak on such topics rather heat- 
edly. I’m hopeful that the coming decades will smooth 
over these differences and sooth the contentions. Evere- 
ska is a beautiful place, and I see no reason to mar that 
beauty with an argument among friends. 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 
82 — - 


Fields of the Dead 

The expanse known as the Fields of the Dead has 
been the battleground for myriad wars and skirmishes 
over the centuries. It is said that the hills that dot the 
countryside here all hold the dead, and there is some 
measure of truth to that— many of the hillocks are 
indeed barrows, raised to house the fallen dead of one 
faction or nation on either side of a war. I have seen 
more than one such barrow, either broken open from 
the outside by those seeking lost treasures, or somehow 
broken from within. 

The Fields of the Dead is a vast, rolling plain of 
windswept grasses that seems to go on to the hori- 
zon in every direction. Regular travelers through the 
area speak of the “whispers of the dead," the popular 
term for the sound that results when a breeze rustles 
the grass. The wind almost always blows here, and it 
isn’t uncommon to smell salt in the air even dozens of 
leagues inland. 

Though this land is uncivilized, it isn't barren. Even if 
many monsters hide in the tall grass or build burrows 
in the sides of the hills, the fields represent an opportu- 
nity for shepherds and free folk to claim a plot that no 
one else has yet occupied. Small, stout farmhouses and 
even a few walled enclosures that contain several such 
dwellings can occasionally be found a short distance 
away from the roads and rivers that run through or near 
the Fields. 

The folk of this land are kind but wary, usually willing 
to share their wells or cisterns, and part with the goods 
they store away in return for goods in trade. I have met 
a few who show greater hospitality, letting strangers 
make camp within the shelter of the low stone walls that 
surround their steadings. They are a good and honest 
people, by and large. 

Away from the vicinity of these settlements, there are 
threats aplenty. Small bands of nomadic humanoids 
traverse these grasslands, as do monsters from out of 
the Wood of Sharp Teeth to the south, the Trollclaws to 
the north, or the serpent kingdom of Najara to the east. 
Occasionally, one of the barrows bulges and vomits 
forth undead, wakened by some instinct known only to 
them, or a patch of terrain buckles and collapses in on 
itself, revealing a sinkhole to warrens beneath. 

Dragonspear Castle 

Though the structure is crumbled and perpetually 
shrouded in mist, more than one of the caravans I've 
guided through these lands have seen Dragonspear 
Castle from afar and expressed a desire to seek shelter 
there. As I tell them at such times, it is better to seek 
shelter inside an opened tomb in these lands, and 
crawl in to huddle among the warrior dead within, than 
to seek anything like sanctuary from Dragonspear. 

Built by an adventurer named Daeros after he found 
a wealth of gems in a sunken dwarven settlement, 
Dragonspear Castle was erected above the very cav- 
erns where that settlement— fallen Kanaglym— was 
interred. Two hundred years ago, sorcerous machina- 
tions brought about the fall of Daeros and the opening 
of an infernal portal in the depths of the castle. 


After that event, Dragonspear’s ruins were occu- 
pied by hobgoblins and myriad bands of bandits, until 
Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate sent troops to root them 
out. Discovering that the portal yet existed, but unable 
to destroy it, they established the Hold of Battle Lions, 
a fortified temple of Tempus, in an attempt to prevent 
anything from coming through. In time, though, devils 
broke through new portals inside the castle's walls and 
overran the defenders. 

Then came the Second Dragonspear War, more than 
a century ago, during which a strange cloak of mist 
settled over the castle, and the forces of Waterdeep 
and Baldur's Gate once more attacked. This time, they 
defeated the devils, leaving the castle ruined and still 
cloaked in mists. At least one other time since then, 
the devils have punched back through, amassing other 
fell creatures to attack the nearby settlements (notably 
Daggerford), but they have been fought off by adventur- 
ers each time. The most recent stories tell of heroes 
confronting Red Wizards of Thay and other devilry. I 
pray that this will be the last time such efforts are nec- 
essary, but somehow, I think not. 

Today, Dragonspear remains crumbled and mist- 
shrouded. Rumors say that the castle— seemingly 
quiescent— has become home to undead horrors of some 
sort, but no one seems terribly inclined to investigate 
such claims, so long as they don't threaten the folk who 
live nearby. Some interested parties out of Baldur’s Gate 
offered me more than a fair amount of coin to investi- 
gate the truth of these rumors, though I demurred. I 
don’t fancy myself an investigator or a spy, and I know 
better than to seek out whatever foulness might have 
taken hold in this place. 

Trollclaws 

A tangled landscape of rough hills along the north- 
ern edge of the Fields of the Dead, the Trollclaws are 
home to a great many of the regenerating, bloodthirsty 
beasts. Exactly what makes these hills such prime 
ground for trolls is unknown (and a favorite topic of 
conversation around many of the campfires I’ve sat at 
while passing through or near this place), but there’s 
no doubt that they dwell here in great numbers. 

Those traveling south to Baldur's Gate or north out 
of the Fields of the Dead typically travel through the 
Trollclaws. The Trollclaw Ford, so named for obvious 
reasons, is the only place for leagues that wagons can 
safely cross the Winding Water. Important as it is, the 
site has been occupied by several forces over the years, 
as evidenced by the ruined remnants of forts and similar 
buildings nearby. But those claimants have always fallen 
eventually to prolonged assaults by trolls. My advice is to 
avoid the region entirely, but if you can’t, keep a lit torch 
handy at all times. 

HA RTS VALE 

I have been to Hartsvale only once, and found it sur- 
passingly beautiful each time. Its wonders are wild 
and untamed, with even the so-called civilization of 
the place exuding a kind of primal beauty that is found 
nowhere else that I know of.

A sco re 


v\r/i Forest 


Hartsvale is far in the windswept north, a fertile 
mountain valley where the Ice Spire Mountains abut 
the High Ice. The Clear Whirl River, easily the clean- 
est and coldest I have ever bathed in, flows south into 
the valley out of the lands of the Endless Blizzard, 
feeding the rich soil tucked between the northern and 
southern arms of the Ice Spires. The river splits as it 
runs through the hilly lands, eventually draining into 
a series of lakes along the southern edge of the vale. 
Two small woods also grow in the vale, one along its 
northern edge, between the vale proper and the north- 
ern Ice Spires, and another fed by the lakes on its 
southern edge. 

Originally the home of giant clans and ragtag barbar- 
ian tribespeople related to the Uthgardt, Hartsvale was 
conquered by the hero Hartkiller. He was a giant who 
had ventured into the lands to the south and learned of 
their ways. When he came to Hartsvale, he rallied the 
human tribes, uniting them into a fighting force capa- 
ble of defeating the giants who tyrannized them, and 
they threw the giants down, claiming the vale between 
the mountains for their descendants. 

Giants aplenty still dwell in Hartsvale’s mountains 
and forested hills, but they’ve reached an accord with 
the humans of the vale. So far as I know, they live 
peaceably distant from the human lands, and taboos 
exist among both humans and giants that keep them 
separate. In my time in Hartsvale, I saw no giants, but 
surely I saw their works. At the boundaries of lands 
where humans (and other folk smaller than giants) 
may not go stand titanic menhirs, likely erected by 
stone giants. 

The folk of Hartsvale are ruled by House Hartwick, 
a line of royals supposedly descended from Hartkiller. 
Though human, House Hartwick’s scions are all very 
tall and strong, most standing seven feet in height. 

The king of Hartsvale sits on the Alabaster Throne in 
Castle Hartwick, and the many earls of the vale’s duch- 
ies owe their fealty to him. 

Peace has reigned for many years in Hartsvale. 
Grauman, called the Good King by his people, sits 
the Alabaster Throne, though his years are advanced. 
His eldest son and heir, Taumarik, is a young ranger 
who has recently returned from a three-year journey 


to explore the North. He came back with a wife, the 
sorceress Ylienna of Silverymoon, and has begun to 
take on more of his father’s onerous responsibilities. 
There is some strife in the court, however, for the earls 
don’t seem to trust his “out-vale witch-bride” (a phrase 
that infuriates Taumarik, but seems to gently amuse 
Ylienna). For myself, I found the lady Ylienna a delight 
on the one occasion when I was in her company. 

The vale is well guarded, as all jewels should be — in 
this case by the perils of the mountains and giant- 
steads that surround it. Nonetheless, a certain strong 
breed of merchant travels the narrow mountain passes 
leading into Hartsvale. The dwarves of Citadel Adbar 
jestingly refer to these people as “goats of coin,” for 
they will cling like such animals to the most precarious 
of mountain ridges while seeking the opportunities 
that wait beyond. My own journeys with the goats of 
coin have impressed upon me the skill of these folk, 
who brave crumbling paths, avalanche-ridden passes, 
terrible howling blizzards, and monsters of all sorts to 
reach Hartsvale and get safely out of the vale again. 

It isn’t merely the high mountains around the vale 
that hold dangers. Though the valley has scattered 
settlements, all of Hartsvale can hardly be considered 
civilized. In my time traveling these lands (with one of 
the few goats of coin that refused to be daunted by the 
fens around Castle Hartwick), I’ve found these lands 
to be still frontier-like, similar to some of the wilder 
portions of the North, particularly in the days before 
the founding of Luruar and the resettlement of Mithral 
Hall. Fell beasts aplenty make their lairs in out-of-the- 
way places across the valley, and raiding bands of ogres 
often come down out of the mountains. 

Castle Hartwick and Stagwick 

Between two branches of the Clear Whirl River lies 
a great island on which Hartkiller built his castle. 
Stagwick, on the east bank of the river, is a small 
community of folk who work as farmers, fishers, herd- 
ers, and artisans. These folk do a brisk business, as 
most outland merchants choose not to journey beyond 
Stagwick and instead sell their wares to the Hartsvale 
merchants. Perhaps a third of the merchants who jour- 
ney to Hartsvale choose to undertake the trip out to 
the fiefdoms of the earls, who pay more to encourage 
this behavior. 

The Ogres 

For reasons I can’t fathom, Harstvale and its sur- 
rounding mountain ranges host many tribes of 
ogres— indeed, not mere family groups, but whole 
tribes of them! Whereas elsewhere ogres seem to live 
like bears, near Hartsvale they act more like ores. 
Thankfully the brutes are still too stupid for such com- 
plex tasks as working metal, but from what I heard 
in my time in the vale their culture is surprisingly 
sophisticated. Different tribes worship different gods, 
Vaprak being the one I heard most about, and these 
differences in religion apparently set the tribes against 
each other. From what I heard, both the giants and the 
people of Hartsvale hate the ogres, a fact for which I’m 
sure many are grateful. If one or more giants decided 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH

to organize the ogres, I don’t know if any in Hartsvale 
could stand against them. 

Helm’s Hold 

Helm’s Hold has stood as a place of watchfulness and 
protection for generations. Ever since its foundation by 
the Company of Crazed Venturers, travelers have used it 
as a safe place to rest and recuperate on their journeys. 
Even during the dark times when Helm ceased showing 
signs to his faithful, the priests and people at Helm's 
Hold kept their doors open and their eyes on the road, 
providing refuge to any who came in peace. This outlook 
was recently sorely tested, and I'm uncertain if Helm’s 
Hold passed or failed the test. 

Even though the Watcher was destroyed just prior to 
the Spellplague, the faithful toiled on through terrible 
times to complete a grand central temple for the good 
of the community and the glory of their god. The kindly 
clergy of this temple, dubbed the Cathedral of Helm, 
took in those who had been touched by the plague or 
rendered insane by the destruction of Mystra’s Weave. 
Sadly, as all too often occurs, corruption crept into the 
settlement, in the form of predatory creatures and male- 
factors who sought to experiment on the unfortunates in 
the care of the temple 

In time the leadership of Helm’s Hold was itself 
corrupted, falling into the hands of a shapeshifting suc- 
cubus, who turned many monks into willing servitors. 
When her machinations were at last revealed and the 
battle for Helm’s Hold began, other otherworldly forces 
came to the fore: summoned devils, undead raised 
from the very crypts of the temple, and tentacled, jel- 
ly-skinned things whose origin I dare not consider. With 
the aid of adventurers from nearby Neverwinter, all 
were defeated and Helm’s Hold at last cleansed. 

Order of the Gilded Eye 
Among those stalwarts who saved Helm’s Hold was a 
member of the Order of the Gauntlet. This man was 
Javen Tarmikos, and seeing the horrors unleashed on 
the world in Helm’s Hold, he found his own order at 
fault. The Order of the Gauntlet doesn’t punish the crim- 
inal before the crime is committed. When evil arises, 
members of the order strike and strike hard, but they 
leave the ores alone in their mountains and don’t disturb 
dragons in their slumber. After Helm’s Hold, Javen found 
this philosophy flawed. Evils unlooked for can breed in 
the shadows, growing stronger until they attack. This 
seemed particularly true of otherworldly threats, such 
as portals to fiendish realms, evil spirits that seek to 
possess the living, and the corrupting influences of 
alien planes. 

Javen says he was ruminating on this when he 
received a sign of Helm’s return. In the main chapel, 
the faithful had erected a new symbol of Helm after the 
last had been desecrated. Javen says he was gazing at 
this symbol and meditating on his order’s failure when 
Helm’s unblinking eye wept tears of gold. Soon after, 
uncorrupted priests of Helm’s Hold, men and women 
who had remained ever watchful for Helm’s return, 
experienced their own divine signs. In response to 
prayers, some were even rewarded with spells. Javen 




took those priests and followers from the Order of 
the Gauntlet loyal to him and formed a new order, 
swearing them in under the watchful gaze of Helm’s 
still-weeping eye. 

The Order of the Gilded Eye is dedicated to protecting 
the world and good people by rooting out hidden evils 
and severing connections with other planes. According 
to their members, it’s not enough to fight threats that 
arise. Many lives can be saved if the signs of evil and 
those who dabble in darkness are actively sought out 
and destroyed before they open the gateways to larger 
threats. Since its founding, the Order of the Gilded 
Eye has grown in number and its capacity to deal with 
threats, welcoming exorcists, abjurers, and spies, as 
well as paladins and clerics of Helm. I’ve even heard 
that assassins bear the order’s symbol— Helm’s eye 
upon a golden gauntlet curled into a fist— and it is a 
claim I can’t disregard. The Order of the Gilded Eye can 
be brutal in their pursuit of evil. 

Did Helm’s symbol weep as Javen Tarmikos and 
others have said? If it did, was Javen’s creation of this 
order Helm’s intention? Is the Helm that has returned 
from death different from the god whose worship was 
familiar to me in my youth? How can we mortals know? 
Helm was ever a god of watchfulness and protection, but 
that didn’t make him a just god, nor a kindly one. 

Whatever the truth may be, know this: The Order of 
the Gilded Eye controls Helm’s Hold now. If you hide 
evil in your heart, or if there is the whiff of something

Places and People of the Hold 
Helm’s Hold is still a relatively small settlement: a 
handful of streets that encircle a central marketplace, 
with sturdy stone-and-timber embankment walls all 
the way around. In the center of town sits the Heart- 
ward, a large marketplace with several rows of stalls 
radiating out from its central feature, an old gallows 
that doesn't see much use these days. The market is 
so named for the shrine to Sune that once stood along 
its edge. That shrine has since been replaced by a 
recently constructed temple to Lady Firehair, called 
the Heartward Hall. 

Not far from Heartward lies the town hall, a former 
inn that has been turned into the council building where 
the Speakers of Helm’s Hold meet. The Speakers are 
the duly elected representatives of the hold, numbering 
eight in all, plus the Chief Speaker. The current Chief 
Speaker is Amarandine Wanderfoot, an older halfling 
matron who was an adventurer in her day. The Speak- 
ers work closely with the Holy Watcher to see to the 
proper governance of the hold. 

A short distance from the town hall lies the Ventur- 
er’s Rest, a favorite stopping-off point of adventurers 
in the area, and of the locals who like to sit at the bar 
and listen to the tales such folk bring with them. The 
Rest was until recently called the Old Dirty Dwarf, but 
was rechristened by its new owner, a winsome Chaunt- 
ean paladin by the name of Kharissa Anuvien. Dame 
Kharissa claims that one of her ancestors was in the 
Company of Crazed Venturers, associated with the

founding of Helms Hold, and her quick-rising popularity 
among the people has won her a seat as a Speaker. 

Dominating the skyline of the hold is the great edi- 
fice: the Cathedral of Helm. As much a fortification as 
it is a temple, the cathedral has a small building on its 
grounds that serves as an orphanage, wards for caring 
for the sick and injured, as well as a newer addition that 
houses the mad and deformed who have been brought 
up from the catacombs. 

The settlement enjoys prosperity today, but such 
benefit was hard-won and requires vigilance to retain. 
Helm’s Hold is vulnerable on many fronts, in large part 
because of its proximity to Neverwinter Wood— which, if 
anything, has become more dangerous in recent times. 
Rumors of maddened treants abound, as well as stories 
of Uthgardt barbarians once again raiding the trails that 
lead to the hold. 

Worse still, the Holy Watcher has seen premonitions 
of something unspeakable rising from the depths 
beneath the hold, bringing down the lowest vaults of the 
cathedral in its bloody ascension. As a result, the temple 
has dramatically increased guard patrols in the tunnels, 
perhaps as a prelude to hiring adventurers to explore 
the tunnels deep under Helm's Hold for some clue of 
what those visions might portend. 

High Forest 

Anyone with even a hint of elven blood can't help but feel 
it stir upon setting foot in the High Forest. The sheer 
age and the power of the trees, the depth of their roots, 
and the wind whispering through their leaves— all these 
things call to us. 

A vast green cloak in the midst of the North, the High 
Forest is a reminder of ages past, when thick woods 
blanketed much of Faerun, and sylvan creatures of all 
types lived among the trees. Even today the High Forest 
has barely known the tread and touch of humans, and 
old growth dominates its flora. 

Elven communities in the forest are typically small 
and often nomadic. In part, this is a reflection of the 
desire to keep the woods untouched, but there are ruins 
here, such as those of Ascalhorn— now called Hellgate 
Dell— that remind us of the fallen cities and empires 
of the past. 

The High Forest once sheltered three great elven 
realms beneath its boughs, and the bones of those 
empires still lie tangled in its roots. Many tribes of wood 
elves— and a few moon elf tribes— still roam the wood 
protecting these ruins, the monuments to their golden 
age. Few beyond the borders of the High Forest know 
much about these elves, who have no single leader and 
make little contact with the outside world. Travelers in 
the High Forest must always be wary of elves they meet 
for they can never be sure of their welcome, and any 
promises of safe passage might not be honored by the 
next band of elves. 

One elf is leading the effort to change this situation. 
Known as the Red Lady, or simply the Lady of the Wood, 
Morgwais is a wood elf who seeks to unite the disparate 
tribes. She leads the Caerilcarn, the “Council of the 
Wood,” which periodically gathers many tribal leaders 
together to share information, consult, and deliberate. 

CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 


Her stated aim is to resurrect the kingdom of Eaerlann, 
and she has made bold steps in that direction by allying 
the settlements of Nordahaeril, Reitheillaethor, and Teu- 
veamanthaar (which most know as Tall Trees). As yet 
though, the elves who believe in this vision are small in 
number and spread far apart over the eastern reaches of 
the High Forest. 

Fey and sylvan creatures of all sorts— including satyrs, 
dryads, and treants— inhabit the High Forest. Small 
wonder that one almost immediately feels the presence 
of unseen watchers upon entering the woods. 

Nowhere in the forest is this feeling more palpable 
than near the Grandfather Tree, an oak larger than 
you might imagine possible, which serves as a holy site 
for the Treeghost tribe of the Uthgardt. Four smaller 
oaks— enormous indeed, though still smaller than the 
Grandfather— mark the boundaries of the site, protect- 
ing the tree and aiding those whom its spirits determine 
are worthy, speeding their natural healing. Teleporta- 
tion magic often goes awry here, and the caverns deep 
beneath the site are rumored to contain all manner of 
magical portals. 

If it isn't the elves, the fey, or the trees themselves 
watching visitors, it might be the centaurs who make 
the High Forest their home, claiming the plateaus near 
the head of the Unicorn Run. For decades, the centaurs 
have been growing in number, enough so that they may 
soon divide their tribes and claim additional lands as 
their territory. Pegasi and unicorns can be found here, 
and even some of the fabled aarakocra, the winged bird- 
folk, live among the peaks at the heart of the wood. 

Within the depths of the forest is an entire mountain 
range known as the Star Mounts. Constant strong 
winds keep weaker flying creatures from approaching 
the peaks of the mountains, with the strange excep- 
tion of the aarakocra, who had an ancestral homeland 
there before being chased out by a dragon. Most the 
peaks may be viewed only from afar, and at a distance 
they seem to glitter from the strange, massive crystals 
dotting their slopes. They are also known to hold rich 
deposits of iron and nickel, but no one has mined these 
mountains in hundreds of years. 

The Star Mounts are the source of the waters of 
the Unicorn Run, which cuts through the rocks of the 
lower range to form a series of gorges and cliffs known 
as the Sisters. The sight of the tiered waterfalls is 
positively breathtaking, well worth the challenge of 
reaching them. Mist shrouds the Sisters, and feeds 
the vegetation on the small plateaus of the area. To 
the north, the headwaters of the Dessarin River flow 
down from a smaller pair of mountains called the 
Lost Peaks. 

Far less idyllic are the cursed ruins of Karse. Here are 
the remains of the great heresy of the Netherese wizard 
Karsus, who sought to claim godhood, slew the god- 
dess of magic, and brought about the end of an age and 
untold destruction across the entire world. 

High Moor 

The High Moor was once a place much like the High 
Forest or the nearby Misty Forest, but during the Crown 
Wars, thousands of years ago, powerful magic burned 


ItfW'. ft firs- “ <4911 



of Illuskan I'd not heard before, and my first meetings 
with them were quite tense and filled with misappre- 
hension. However, I came to know people from both 
the Girondi and Belcondi tribes, all of whom acted with 
bravery, honor, and good humor in my presence. Trav- 
elers in this region should note that the human tribes 
share the suspicion of magic common among many 
Northlanders, but thankfully it isn’t the fanatic hatred 
shown by the Uthgardt. 

There are also some small ore tribes, Redclaw and 
Blue Feather, among them. The humans and goblinoids 
both despise the ores, and my hosts said they allied 
with one another in the past when the ores grew great 
in number. 

Orogoth 

For such a large expanse, the High Moor contains few 
known ruins. One such is Orogoth, the former villa of 
a noble family of old Netheril. Local legends say the 
family dabbled in dragon magic, attempting to capture 
those powerful wyrms and acquire their powers. The 
tales differ as to what folly led to the family becom- 
ing immolated in its home, but most agree the culprit 
was a dracolich, of all things, residing in the ruin and

the land such that all that remained was a blasted moor. 
It is a rocky wilderness infested with trolls and gobli- 
noids and all manner of other dangers for anyone who 
treks across it instead of going around. 

As the name suggests, the High Moor is a raised area 
extending for many miles of heath, lichen-covered out- 
croppings, and hidden gullies. Herd animals wander 
the land, from sheep to rock ponies to the occasional 
rothe. These beasts graze without great risk, because 
wolves and other predators that would thin the herds 
are themselves the prey of the trolls and goblinoids 
that otherwise rule the moor. These two-legged threats 
sometimes seed the High Moor with traps, but are nor- 
mally occupied with fighting and killing their prey and 
each other. There is something of a cycle to the hunts of 
the High Moor: wolves are killed off by the hobgoblins 
one year, leading to more sheep grazing, which brings 
the trolls out (the local trolls enjoy mutton, it seems), 
which brings intrepid adventurers to deal with the 
growing menace, enabling just enough of the wolves to 
survive that they aren’t wiped out completely. 

Human barbarians also inhabit the High Moor, living 
mostly on its western fringes with large herds of sheep 
and goats, the soil being too thin and too poor for farm- 
ing. They aren’t Uthgardt or related to them, but they 
might have some distant ties to the Northlanders, as 
they seem to be of Illuskan stock. They speak a dialect

Rhymanthiin: Hidden City of Hope 

Stories persist that Faer’tel’miir, an ancient city of 
Miyeritar, was restored by High Magic sometime in the 
last century— perhaps even before the Spellplague— up 
on the High Moor. The restored city of dark, smooth 
stone, called Rhymanthiin, or “The Hidden City of 
Hope,” appears on no maps, and is reputedly concealed 
by magic or some other artifice. Supposedly only those 
who are worthy, without malice in their hearts, may 
reach it, while others (as the tales have it) “shall not find 
their way there.” Such tale-tellers must be few and far 
between, as I know of no one who can rightly claim to 
have seen it, but still the stories seem to have a life of 
their own. 


Najara 

Gone are the days when the tales of a kingdom of ser- 
pents were rumor and hearsay, stories concocted by 
adventurers and travelers who strayed far off the path 
and somehow managed to escape. It was once easy 
to doubt their veracity, for what nation didn’t patrol its 
borders or establish communication (amicable or other- 
wise) with other nations? The stories of naga and yuan-ti 
were easy enough to believe, for this area had always 
hosted such things. But a nation of such creatures? 

As we now know, the kingdom of Najara, as pro- 
claimed by the serpents that live within, lies along the 
northern edge of the Trade Way, northeast of Boareskyr 
Bridge and southeast of the High Moor. The Winding 
Water flows through these lands, and its other main geo- 
graphical features are the Serpent Hills, the Marsh of 
Chelimber, and the Forest of Wyrms. 

I discovered for myself the truth of Najara, the King- 
dom of Serpents, when a sage in Baldur’s Gate hired me 
to guide him, his apprentices, and a handful of adventur- 
ers to some ruins in the eastern edges of the High Moor. 
I will forever regret accepting that commission, for not 
only did half the adventurers turn out to be greedy swine 
intent on plundering the ruins rather than allowing the 
sage his study, but their idiocy awoke an ancient spirit 
that caused most of the group to drop off into a deathly 
sleep while it consumed their souls. Since I am unaf- 
fected by magics that force slumber, I escaped, along 
with a half-elf among the apprentices to the sage. The 
spirit chased us across the moors relentlessly, forcing 
us into the tunnels beneath the Serpent Hills, where we 
were taken prisoner by yuan-ti patrolling the borders of 
their domain. The half-elf was hauled away in slaver’s 
chains, but for some reason I was taken to the court of 
Jarant, the Serpent King. A brief account of that experi- 
ence follows. 

Ancient and evil, the spirit naga Jarant rules the king- 
dom by virtue of his personal power and thanks to the 
aid of the Marlspire of Najara, a thin silver crown that 
has protective and other magical abilities. Though he 
still preferred to remain utterly isolated from the outside 
world at the time when I met him, ten years ago the 
Dark Serpent began sending ambassadors to neighbor- 
ing kingdoms to warn them about the consequences 
of interfering in Najaran matters. Though I saw the 
king for but a moment, Jarant’s influence in his realm 
is undeniable, for his name is spoken reverently by all 


defending the family’s wealth. The gods only know 
what led to the creation of such a creature or what 
binds it to this place. The answers— if any there be— lie 
within its lair. 

Misty Forest 

West of the High Moor but heavily influenced by it, the 
Misty Forest draws its name from the fog that rolls off 
the heights of the moor to shroud its trees. Melandrach, 
King of the Woods, rules here and holds the forest as 
the exclusive domain of the elves. Though game animals 
roam in plenty, the local humans know well that the 
elves protect them and punish trespassers who poach 
in the forest. Even barbarians know better than to hunt 
here, as they don’t wish to draw Melandrach’s atten- 
tion or ire. 

Travelers who leave the inhabitants of the Misty 
Forest alone, and who build their campfires small and 
solely of fallen branches, are usually permitted to pass, 
so long as the folk of the forest aren’t in a foul mood or 
stirred up against outsiders for some other reason. 

Secomber 

Just off the High Moor, on the north bank of the 
Delimbiyr near the Unicorn Run, is the small town of 
Secomber, on the border between the North and the set- 
tlements of the Western Heartlands. Built over the ruins 
of Hastarl, capital of the ancient kingdom of Athalantar, 
Secomber is a quiet place where fishers and farmers go 
about their work, and local folk hire out to hunt or fish, 
or guide travelers through the area. Skilled guides who 
know the High Moor well, and can navigate its many 
dangers and its local tribes, are common— or appear 
to be, given how often their services are offered. Local 
stonecutters, primarily from a small clan of dwarves, 
excavate pink granite from the rock walls on northern 
edge of the moor. 




his subjects. A guard might swear “by Jarant’s crown* 
to emphasize an edict, and the yuan-ti who owned 
the keys to my shackles referred to Najara’s laws as 
“Jarant’s will.” 

No one knows why Jarant chose the time he did to 
make public his kingdom’s sovereignty, or what he hoped 
to gain by such an act. The yuan-ti ambassadors he sent 
forth made their king’s wishes clear to the nations they 
visited: leave Najaran prosperity alone, and discourage 
intruders (such as adventuring types) from violating 
Najaran borders to steal the fortunes of the serpentfolk. 

In return, the serpents promised that any caravans 
and other legitimate travelers passing through Najara’s 
dominion would be unharmed and unhindered— as long 
as they don’t stray from the main route. 

Reaction among the places approached raged from 
one extreme to the other. Darkhold reportedly feted 
the ambassadors well, and the serpentfolk left with not 
only an agreement from the Zhentish lords, but also an 
offer of a possible future military alliance. Not surpris- 
ingly, Elturgard refused the edict outright— and in the 
process of expressing that refusal, bloodshed erupted. 
The paladins slew all but one of the ambassadors, and 
sent the survivor back to Jarant’s court to communicate 
their answer. 

The other responses to the Najaran ambassadors fell 
somewhere in between. Acceptances and refusals to 
cooperate, usually polite, trickled in, but regardless of 
their substance, Jarant’s goal had been accomplished: 
Najara’s neighbors now saw the realm as a nation, no 
matter whether they viewed it as a potential ally or foe. 

The economy of Najara, such as it is, depends on 
slaves to exist. Slavery is arguably the only actual trade 
conducted in Najara, with the ruins of Thlohtzin in the 
Forest of Wyrms serving as a gathering place for those 
who would stoop so low as to sell slaves to the yuan-ti. 
Different factions among the Najarans have agents 
waiting near Thlohtzin, each hoping to strike a bargain 
with slavers before others arrive. Slaves with unusual 
abilities or specialized knowledge sometimes set off 
bidding wars among the yuan-ti. I fear that such was the 
fate of that apprentice who accompanied me out of the 
High Moor. 

To everyone of any influence who might read this, 
heed my words: do not be misled. The serpents do 
not intend to coexist peacefully— they merely wish to 
use their strange diplomacy as a cloak and a shield, to 
protect them against the vigilance of others until they 
are ready to put their plans, whatever they may be, 
into fruition. 

The Court of the Serpent King 

I was imprisoned in Ss’khanaja, a mostly subterranean 
city on the Winding Water, where gathers the court of 
King Jarant. 

During my time in the custody of the Najarans, I 
learned much about— and from— Dhosun Silverscale. A 
yuan-ti pureblood in Najara, Dhosun acts as a councilor 
to the king and often seeks to mitigate Jarant’s excesses. 
I believe that the sending out of the ambassadors was 
Dhosun’s idea, for while I was imprisoned, he visited me 
several times, asking what I knew of the arts of embassy 


and ambassadorship. From the talk at court, Dhosun 
makes no secret of his desire to help his king build a 
nation whose status equals or outmatches other realms 
across the face of Faerun. Jarant keeps him near, it is 
said, because of all the king’s courtiers, Dhosun is the 
likeliest to attempt to steal away the Marlspire. Whether 
or not he is capable of such an act, I found the yuan-ti 
naga to be honorable— it was he who secretly arranged 
the opportunity I needed to escape, and I know he has 
done likewise for others in the past. I owe him a debt I 
intend to repay one day. 

Another figure of note in the court is the cunning 
green dragon Emikaiwufeg, often called the Emerald 
Daughter. She is young for a dragon and still small 
enough to fit in tunnels leading down to Jarant’s audi- 
ence chamber. Jarant is said to appreciate the twists 
and turns of her wit. Some courtiers believe that she is 
frequently kept to hand as a foil to Dhosun, as her slickly 
vicious nature offsets the Dhosun’s more honorable ten- 
dencies. For my part, I believe she’s biding her time. A 
great many metallic dragons dwell in the Serpent Hills, 
and a clear rival for mates, wealth, and power— the 
green dragon known as Ralionate— lives in the nearby 
forest of Wyrms. 

A variety of advisors and hangers-on can be found 
within Jarant’s court, which is a dangerous place. A 
trio of yuan-ti warlocks, who claim to have tapped into 
the vestiges of the ancient serpent deity once wor- 
shiped at Ss’thar’tiss’ssun, leads the yuan-ti of Najara, 
though at court they frequently lurk in the background, 
simply watching. 

Serpent Hills 

The Serpent Hills is a desolate region of red clay hills 
and deep, treacherous ravines, featuring stretches of 
rough, ridged land surrounding tall mesas. Only scrub 
can manage to grow here, tenaciously clinging to the 
dry clay. Beneath this perilous territory— filled with 
serpents and poisonous creatures of all manner— lie the 
Serpent Ways, a series of intricate, well-guarded tunnels 
interspersed with caverns and chambers. The pas- 
sages serve as the main pathways for the folk of Najara 
through these lands; indeed, it was while resting within 
such a cavern that the half-elf apprentice and I were 
captured by yuan-ti. I have since learned that in general, 
the serpents don’t care who tromps over the hills, so 
long as they stay out of the places under them. The Naja- 
ran capital city, Ss’khanaja, is found in the northwest 
of the Serpent Hills, but an even larger population of 
snakefolk live beneath the surface. It is common to find 
settlements inside the large underground chambers 
connected by the tunnels, excavations many centu- 
ries in age. 

Marsh of Chelimber 

I didn’t have occasion to travel to Chelimber before my 
“sojourn” with the Narajan court, but I did ask Dhosun 
about the place. It was through those questions that 
he divined my intention to escape, in fact, and offered 
his aid. A vast marshland pocked with sulfurous pools 
that often gout their steaming contents high into the 
air, the marsh is inhospitable even to most serpents; 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 


the majority of the denizens in these lands are lizard- 
folk. Once a Netherese principality, ruled by vampires, 
and then a holding of the Zhentarim, the Marsh of 
Chelimber is solidly within the grasp of Najara today. 
Though each tribe of lizardfolk is dominated by a chief- 
tain from among their kind, each of those leaders has 
sworn fealty to the King of Najara. 

Forest of Wyrms 

In the end. it was through the Forest of Wyrms that I 
fled Najara, though Dhosun advised me against doing 
so. Ultimately, I chose it for the same reason he tried 
to discourage me: because only a fool would enter this 
wood intentionally. The forest is infested with a great 
many serpents of both normal and monstrous varieties. 

Sages who have studied the serpent-life of the forest 
claim that some force seems to draw ophidian creatures 
here and then changes them— varieties of snake that 
ought not be poisonous bite with envenomed fang in this 
forest, and most breeds of snake grow to nearly double 
their size here. Ralionate, an ancient green dragon 
apparently not aligned with the yuan-ti, makes this 
forest her lair. It is good terrain for her; tall redwoods 
and coarse pines create a dense, dark canopy. 

Dhosun warned me that the ruins of Ss’thar’tiss'ssun, 
an ancient temple-city, lie in the northern fringes of the 
forest. At some point in the distant past, humans built 
a small settlement, once called Serpents Cowl, above 
these ruins, but it now stands empty, likely due to the 
depredations of yuan-ti. Though discernible as little 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 


more than low hills in the forest today, Dhosun told me 
that deep inside the ruins lies the Shrine of the Cowled 
Serpents, a site of pilgrimage for the serpent-folk. 

A place of great danger within the forest is Thlohtzin, 
once the citadel of a lich and now an important site in 
Najara’s slave trade. Slavers from around the region 
know that the serpent-folk pay good coin for slaves 
brought here. They are then usually transported to other 
places in Najara for service. 

I chose to make my escape from Najara through the 
Forest of Wyrms because, though serpent-infested, it 
is a woodland yet, and I am at home in such places. I 
moved through its shadows, remaining deep enough 
within the forest to avoid notice but not so far as to come 
near its heart, and then skirted its edges until I could 
see the hills of Trielta in the distance. 

Trielta Hills 

In the rolling terrain of the Trielta Hills, scattered with 
small settlements of gnomes and halflings, life seems 
pastoral and idyllic. Halfling farmers tend to their plots, 
and gnome miners scrape out the interior of the hills 
seeking the bits of gold and silver they may find waiting 
there. No warlords threaten this land, no liches or drag- 
ons plot to seize it for themselves. There are no great 
castles to covet here, nor ruins to pillage. All told, the 
place seems dull and unremarkable. 

That, of course, is just the way its residents like it. 
They enjoy their solitude, which is broken only rarely. 



The hills of Trielta do occasionally offer up some 
impressive bounty, in the form of heretofore-undiscov- 
ered gold and silver. While such finds are usually small 
lodes that are played out almost before others become 
aware of them, Trielta has played host to full-on gold 
rushes from time to time. Someone stumbles on a 
particularly large vein of ore, and prospectors and for- 
tune-seekers come pouring in by the dozens. Trieltan 
folk tend to see these occasional influxes of gold-hungry 
seekers the way other settlements look upon periodic 
plagues of locusts: aggravating, inevitable, and thor- 
oughly disruptive, but also part of the natural order, and 
so nothing to get bothered about. 

Indeed, even the largest of these discoveries isn’t so 
lucrative as to be worth the construction of the full-scale 
mining operations that can be found in other lands. No 
large nations or trading consortiums are waiting in the 
wings to invade and take over the mines of Trielta. They 
are what a dwarf acquaintance of mine once referred 
to as “scratch mines”— close-to-the-surface operations, 
with decent yield for a small amount of digging, but 
not worth the construction of “proper” (by which he of 
course meant dwarven) mines. 

I was in Trielta resting after my escape from Najara 
when just such an outbreak of “gold on the brain” (as 
the locals term it) occurred. Though most of those who 
come at such times are honest prospectors seeking to 
make their fortunes, the sudden opportunity for wealth 
does attract less scrupulous sorts, including all manner 
of thieves, swindlers, and claims-jumpers— not to 
mention monsters that prey on unlucky or ill-prepared 
miners who unknowingly invade their territory. 

The most intense traveling Ive done through these 
hills was in pursuit of a band of marauding lizardfolk. 
The head of the kindly gnome family I was staying with 
was taken prisoner, along with his oldest son. I helped 
the local halfling sheriff and the small band of militia he 
put together to track the band, and to do so quickly, res- 
cuing the captives. I’ve been welcomed in this area ever 
since, and have gotten to know the goodly folk here well. 

Hardbuckler 

At the southern edge of the hills lies the walled settle- 
ment of Hardbuckler. It is a town of mostly gnomes, with 
the occasional human, halfling, or half-elf among their 
number. It is one of the best-defended towns I’ve vis- 
ited, with a several batteries of ballistae on impressive 
cog-run cranking mounts that allow for a nearly con- 
stant cycle of firing and reloading from any of the wall 
emplacements. Though the folk of Hardbuckler don’t 
have cause to use them very often, these weapons usu- 
ally discourage the bandits, raiders, and occasional ore 
bands that would lay claim to Hardbuckler’s wealth. 

The town eschews the sort of street network that 
tends to delineate most large settlements; instead it has 
a single street running inside the circular town wall, 

.nd another pair of straight roads crossing the town 
north-to-south and east-to-west that meet in the center 

town in a crossroads marketplace. Many buildings 
- ructured for larger folk line these streets, for taller 
f lk tend to prefer the comfortable familiarity they pro- 
vide, but the rest of the town is made up of a series of 


narrow paths between the smaller-proportioned build- 
ings that are the homes of the city's gnomes. 

The first time I walked along these tight lanes, I felt 
as though I was only seeing a small portion of the actual 
settlement, and I was right. Later I discovered that 
beneath the slate-roofed houses, with their modest little 
adjoining gardens behind plank fences or fieldstone 
walls are the tunnels that constitute the true thorough- 
fares of Hardbuckler. 

Beneath each small dwelling is an extensive cellar, 
often three or more levels in depth. These spaces are 
where the industrious folk of Hardbuckler engage in 
their livelihoods. Some of the cellar spaces are shops 
or workspaces for artisans who sleep in the house 
above. Other of these croftholds rent out their extra 
space to travelers, setting aside a few rooms for rent, 
and using a single large space as an open taproom, 
serving the sort of fare one might find in an inn. The 
food in such an establishment is odd— a great deal 
of mushrooms, potatoes, turnips, dense lichens, and 
stews made of shrews and voles— but filling and tasty in 
its own way. 

The chambers in these underground inns are well 
heated by generous hearths, and thus provide for very 
comfortable accommodations. More than a few mer- 
chants arrange their travels so as to be in Hardbuckler 
ere winter arrives, so that they can spend the cold 
months beside a hearth, with a slice of fried pie in one 
hand, and a tankard of bitter gnomish stout in the other. 

Any cellar space not devoted to another purpose is 
used for storage rather than being left vacant. Almost 
every family in the town has some space that it uses for 
its own needs or rents out for use by others. Those who 
buy storage from a Hardbuckler must purchase their 
storage crates and other necessary goods from local 
artisans, who also make locks, latches, waxy sealants 
for waterproofing crates and boxes, and the like. The 
crates are all built to specific sizes, with shelving and 
space in the cellars measured so that each container fits 
snugly and exactly. 

Hardbuckler has a well-paid wizard who provides 
magical security for stored items, for those who wish it. 
Outlander wizards aren’t permitted to lay wards or pro- 
tections on goods destined for the cellars— such must 
be applied by Daelia Inchtarwurn, the latest wizard in a 
long line of folk who have worked in Hardbuckler over 
the generations. She wears a set of magical bracers 
passed to her by her father. 

Rural Settlements 

Most of the outlying settlements in the Trielta Hills 
consist of a dozen or two dozen halfling or gnome fam- 
ilies, living in homes molded gently into rolling hills. 
Relatively shallow valleys serve as agricultural land, 
while the slopes are used for growing vine crops (such 
as pumpkins and strawberries) or grazing small herds 
of the large-horned sheep many of the halfling families 
keep, or the ornery braid-bearded goats favored by 
gnome goatherds. 

Most of these small communities aren’t exclusively 
populated by halflings or gnomes, since such groups 
seem to prosper better when members of both races

are in residence. Halfling families often focus on agri- 
cultural endeavors (aside from the small fungi gardens 
many gnomish households maintain in their cellars), 
while the area s miners are almost exclusively gnomes. 
Both folk work as herders, with halflings favoring 
sheep, and gnomes goats, as well as artisans of all 
sorts. Each community has a sheriff who maintains 
peace and leads defense— a role most often fulfilled 
by a halfling, I’ve found, though gnomes will certainly 
rise up in defense of their homes and neighbors when 
called upon. 

Some of the rural settlements mark the former 
locations of mines that have been played out. It isn’t 
uncommon for halflings to move in where a gnomish 
mine have been abandoned, fixing up the surface 
entrances into acceptable, comfortable homes, with 
built-in tunnels that worm through the settlement. 

These passages might be helpful for defense or escape, 
but they are most often used when it’s raining out to 
reach a neighbor’s door and borrow a cup of honey, so 
as not to get oneself wet or track mud everywhere. 

On occasion, a community that sports large dwell- 
ing-tunnels, with ample space for larger folk (or 
"big’uns,” as the local gnomes say), turns its settlement 
into an establishment that caters to such clientele. The 
inns I know of are the Merry Mine-Lass, the Pipe and 
Hearthstone, and the Giants’ Respite, my favorite. 

Each of these settlements is impressively self-sus- 
taining. When official leadership is needed, the eldest 
halflings and gnomes are called upon to act in that 
capacity, but amity is the heart of community life in 
these hills. It is a shameful act among the Trieltans to 
refuse to reach a peaceable accord with one’s fellows 
over some dispute. The folk here enjoy their simple 
lives, although I’ve come across a half-dozen or so 
young adventurers who hail from here, seeking out the 
newness of the world as a contrast to the familiarity of 
their homeland. 

Few dangerous creatures lurk in the hills— they are so 
densely settled (on and beneath the surface) that there 
is little space for monsters to lair. Cruel or ravenous 
creatures do occasionally creep into Trielta, mainly 
from the Forest of Wyrms, but such incursions don’t last 
long— after a few sheep (and possibly a shepherd or two) 
are eaten, the sheriffs waste no time in forming a posse 
to hunt down or chase off the predators before they can 
do more harm. 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 


Now, sad to say, this situation might be changing for 
the worse. According to recent letters I have received 
from friends in these hills, parties of Najaran raiders 
have become more common and numerous. My friends 
fear that the threat from the Serpent Kingdom to the 
north will force Trieltans to seriously consider putting 
up an active defense of their lands for the first time in 
generations. 

Uthgardt Lands 

When I was newly departed from my homeland and first 
found my way to the North, I encountered a band of Uth- 
gardt nomads on the trail— a part of the Elk tribe, led by 
a warrior named Gyrt. It was a tense meeting. 

I think the only reason I was not killed on sight is that 
I was an elf traveling alone. I think they feared I was a 
wizard. Uthgardt hate all magic but that of their sha- 
mans and any enchanted weapons and armor they find, 
but a wizard willing to walk the wilds alone could be a 
powerful one. Traveling as we were on a grassy plain, 
we could see one another for some distance. Since I 
didn’t strike them down with lightning from afar, they 
were willing to approach peaceably. 

Still, they stopped when they were within bowshot 
and seemed to be arguing about whether to shoot me. 

I waited as patiently as I could until one who seemed 
to be their leader addressed me in heavily accented 
Common. I replied a greeting in Bothii, their own 
ancient language, which again set the group to argu- 
ment. At last, the leader dismounted and approached 
me, giving her name as Gyrt. Glad was I then that I took 
the time to learn the language from a learned friend 
in Evereska! 

In anticipation of any demand, I offered Gyrt a fine 
dagger from Evereska, as well as a necklace I wore. For 
her band I offered a bag of baubles I’d brought for such 
an occasion. Pleased with my gifts and assured that I 
was no wizard, Gyrt and I sat down to talk. I asked to 
share her campfire for the night, and Gyrt made space 
for me. That was my first meeting with Gyrt, but it 
wouldn’t be my last, nor my last encounter with Uth- 
gardt. I’m grateful to my friend Gyrt for teaching me so 
much about her people, for it has allowed me and many 
fellow travelers to see Uthgardt and live to tell the tale. 

Over the years, as I earned Gyrt’s respect and she 
mine, we became friends, and I came to know her three 
sons as well. Though Gyrt died some decades ago, I still 
visit her children, whom I played with when they were 
young. They now have children of their own, and all call 
me auntie. 

During my time with Gyrt and her kin, the people of 
the Elk explained much to me about the workings of 
their tribe— their view of the world and their place in 
it, their traditions and the laws they live by. I came to 
realize, as I came across other Uthgardt tribes in my 
travels, that much of what is true for the Elk tribe is true 
for other Uthgardt. Though they comport themselves in 
seemingly disparate groups honoring different totems, 
Uthgardt have much in common. What follows is what 
I have learned of the people who call themselves “chil- 
dren of Uthgar.” 


/ 


Though the Uthgardt each belong to a given tribe, 
these are markers of identity, rather than coherent popu- 
lations.'In my experience, it is rare outside of occasional 
large events (such as the ascension of a new chieftain, or 
certain religious gatherings) for all members of a single 
tribe to come together in one place. Instead, the Uth- 
gardt tend to travel in bands, groups of tribesfolk that 
number between a dozen and a hundred, usually twenty 
to fifty. These bands generally consist of several family 
groups, each led by a matriarch or patriarch. In many 
ways, these folk are similar to nomadic Tel’Quessir ; in 
that they make their decisions by consensus among the 
heads of the families, and disagreements are handled 
efficiently: those who don’t like the decision of the major- 
ity go their own way, forming a new band or joining a 
different one. 

The Uthgardt are spread across the North, rarely 
found farther south than the High Forest. There is no 
nation of Uthgardt to which they belong; instead, each 
tribe has a central ancestral mound, regarded as a holy 
site. Gyrt told me that the holy site of the Elk tribe is at 
a place called Flint Rock, somewhere in the Evermoors. 
She, understandably, never offered to take me there, and 
I was never foolish enough to ask. 

By and large, the Uthgardt are a hunting people who 
rely on game for much of their sustenance, favoring 
large herd animals such as elk, rothe, and deer. Young 
men and women looking to make a name for themselves 
sometimes build their reputations by hunting dangerous 
predators and great beasts: bears, great cats, large boar, 
and even monsters such as wyverns, owlbears, and dis- 
placer beasts. 

Some tribes put the prowess they demonstrate in 
hunting to good use in another endeavor, for which the 
Uthgardt are well known: raiding. As a rule, the Uth- 
gardt engage in raiding only in remote areas— meaning 
that the closer a potential target is to civilization, the 
less likely it will be set upon. The raiders prefer to 
strike against wealthy merchant caravans and nobles’ 
baggage trains, which offer the likelihood of fine foods, 
alcohol, and jewelry that Uthgardt wear as trophies and 
trade among themselves. For the most part, Uthgardt 
have little use for coin, so travelers hoping to buy their 
way out of a confrontation are advised to offer some- 
thing else. 

Uthgardt don’t see national boundaries or the bonds 
of civilization that tie a merchant to a farmer whose 
house the merchant passes on the road. To them each 
interaction with us— meaning we who aren’t Uthgart— 
is different. Thus, an Uthgardt band that raids in one 
season might come to trade during the next. They do 
understand the concept of belonging to a larger group, 
and that those groups might be in conflict. After all, 
each tribe of Uthgardt has its ancestral enemies among 
the other Uthgardt tribes. Yet when I attempted to 
explain how I, and elf from Evereska, was connected to 
folk in Waterdeep or Silverymoon, Gyrt just laughed. 

She had not seen these cities, so I might as well have 
said I knew folk who lived on the moon. When I men- 
tioned Yartar and Red Larch, places that I knew Gyrt’s 
band had passed near, she laughed still harder. To her 
I was too great, too “strong" as she put it, to have any 


The Uthgardt Tribes and Their Territories 

For most Uthgardt tribes, the only stability in their history 
is the site of their ancestral mound. Most of the Uthgardt 
holy sites have existed since antiquity, but the fortunes of 
the tribes that revere them have hardly been static. Follow- 
ing are brief descriptions of the Uthgardt tribes today. 

Blue Bear. The easternmost of the Uthgardt are the Blue 
Bear — thought destroyed more than a century ago — who 
have recently emerged from inside the High Forest and re- 
claimed their ancestral mound at Stone Stand, just south 
of the Moon Pass and north of the forest. The Blue Bears 
have reoccupied much of their old territory in the time 
since they returned to prominence, though they don’t ven- 
ture near Hellgate Keep, considering it a taboo place. 

Black Lion and Red Tiger. North of Blue Bear territory, 
in the Glimmering Wood, is Beorunna’s Well, a settlement 
of some size that near the ancient ancestral mound of the 
Red Tiger tribe. The settlement was founded some time 
ago by members of the Black Lion tribe, who put down 
roots here rather than continuing to live as nomads. 

Though the Red Tigers are less than comfortable with 
the present situation, they consider Beorunna’s Well their 
holy site, so they make the best of things. Bands of Red Ti- 
ger tribespeople often winter in Beorunna's Well, and many 
of its hunters and trappers use the settlement as a place to 
sell the leather and furs they acquire in nearby forests. 

Sky Pony. In a part of the Glimmerwood called the 
Moonwood stands the One Stone, the ancestral mound 
of the Sky Pony tribe. These are a people divided; half of 
the tribe has settled and built a sizable steading around 
the One Stone, similar to what Black Lion has done at 
Beorunna’s Well. The other half of the tribe considers this 
act an insult to their totem, so they launch raids on the 
settlement, burning as much of it as they can and then 
escaping, often on pegasus-back. 

Tree Ghost. In the depths of the High Forest stands the 
Grandfather Tree, the ancestral mound of the Tree Ghost 
tribe. The Tree Ghosts split off from the Blue Bears long 
ago and all but disappeared into the forest, although occa- 
sional reports reach civilization that they are still alive and 
can sometimes be seen clustered around the Grandfather 
Tree. Some sages postulate that the newly reborn Blue 
Bear tribe might well be Tree Ghost Uthgardt who are fol- 
lowing a call from a revived Blue Bear totem. 

Great Worm. The Frost Hills, a small southern spike of 
the Spine of the World Mountains just north of the Ever- 
moors, is the site of Great Worm Cavern, the ancestral 
mound of the Great Worm tribe. These Uthgardt are noto- 
riously reclusive; it has been twenty years since the tribe 
has sent raiding parties out anywhere but against the ores 
of the Spine Mountains. 

Black Raven. As forbidding as the Spine of the World 
Mountains they roam, the Black Ravens are fanatical in 
their adherence to the old Uthgardt ways. Ranging out 
from Raven Rock, their ancestral mound deep inside the 
mountains, they have been known to send raiding parties 
as far south as Silverymoon, but their most frequent tar- 
gets are the caravans that come in and out of Mithral Hall. 

Elk. Flint Rock in the midst of the Evermoors is the an- 
cestral mound of the Elk tribe. The Elk were once prolific 
raiders, extending their reach even into Nesme and Mithral 
Hall, but the tribe was shattered a handful of decades past 
by the forces of those cities. Though their numbers have 
replenished, the Elk remain mostly hunters and foragers. 
They are masters at avoiding or repulsing the threats of 
the Evermoors, and often hire themselves out as guides 
for outsiders. 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 


Lost Tribes of the Uthcardt 

Given the rebirth of the Blue Bear tribe in recent years, it 
might be incorrect to assume that any Uthgardt tribe is 
truly extinct. Nevertheless, several tribes are known today 
only by prior reputation, not present accomplishments. 

The Thunderbeast tribe has not been heard from in 
several years. When the Thunderbeasts made their annual 
pilgrimage to Morgur’s Mound in Neverwinter Wood, they 
found their holy site desecrated. Soon thereafter, their 
chieftain took them back into the depths of the High For- 
est, and they have not emerged since. 

The Gray Wolf tribe, made up of lycanthropes, was de- 
stroyed by a Selunite crusade because of the tribe’s curse. 
Some of the surviving Gray Wolves took shelter among 
other Uthgardt tribes. 

The Griffon tribe came to an untimely end when it rose 
against the forces of Luruar allied with giants and ores. 

The Red Pony and Golden Eagle tribes vanished cen- 
turies ago. They were last seen in the vicinity of the 
One Stone, the ancestral mound those tribes shared 
with Sky Pony. 


connection to places she saw as providing prey for 
her tribe. 

If a band of Uthgardt come upon your campsite, my 
advice is this. First, do what you can to hide all signs of 
magic or spellcasting. Then show them hospitality and 
invite them to warm themselves. If you have jewelry or a 
fine weapon, offer these gifts to the one who seems like 
the leader. Ask how their hunting goes, and give them 
a chance to brag. Be appreciative, but not obsequious. 
Tell them you have heard of the prowess of the Uthgardt 
people— their hunting skills and strength first and fore- 
most— but attribute these claims to a tribe other than 
their own. The strongest among the band will insist on 
the chance to prove him- or herself better than the sto- 
ries you’ve heard, and will want you to bear away tales 
of about his or her tribe instead. 

You or one of your companions might need to agree 
to a challenge of some kind, a feat of strength or a bout 
of fisticuffs, by which the band may measure your prow- 
ess. It doesn’t greatly matter if you win or lose, though. 
Simply express a desire or a willingness to compete, 
and you will earn some measure of respect. If you win 
the challenge, be gracious, and express gratitude that 
you finally found someone of great status to test yourself 
against. If you lose, be self-effacing and rueful, and give 
the victor the best part of the meal at hand. 

This advice will not always work, of course. Some 
bands aren’t so easily assuaged, particularly if they are 
out deliberately hunting you or folk like you. At all times, 
remember that these are a proud and strong people with 
a fierce love of life and its simple pleasures. Demon- 
strate an outlook complementary to theirs, and they 
might make of you a comrade. Show fear or contempt, 
and they will respond with quick violence. 

The People of Uthgar 

The Uthgardt trace their origins back to the mighty 
hero Uthgar, a warrior without compare. During my 
time with his tribe, Gyrt spoke freely of the tales of 
Uthgar that have been passed down among his people. 
The saga begins in the distant past when the humans 
of the North lived in fear and isolation. Great spirits 


roamed the forests of the North, preventing humans 
from banding together to rise up against them. Into 
this turmoil came Uthgar, who challenged each of the 
great spirits, one at a time, besting them and subju- 
gating them to his rule. Each of the defeated spirits 
became embodied in the totem of one of the groups of 
humans who followed and revered Uthgar. Thus were 
born the tribes of the Uthgardt, each taking the name 
of their totem spirit. 

The sites of Uthgar's victories are marked even today 
with the great ancestor-mounds of the Uthgardt. Each 
is said to have been built over the remains of a tribe’s 
totem spirit, along with the tribesfolk who died while 
helping Uthgar to fight the creature. 

A tribe lays claim to the territory around its ancestral 
mound for many leagues, declaring it as the grounds 
in which the tribe hunts and sets up camps. Generally 
speaking, Uthgardt bands of a given tribe will range as 
far as two to three weeks’ travel away from the tribe’s 
ancestral mound, with raiding parties going much far- 
ther afield. These holy sites are scattered through the 
North; in almost all cases, the exact location of one is 
known to few people other than members of that tribe. 

Almost all of the original tribes of the Uthgardt are 
active in the North today. Even a tribe thought to be 
lost or destroyed might be represented somewhere by 
a small number of humans who claim to be descended 
from the one of the tribes of old, but such people, where 
they exist, aren’t numerous by any means, and their 
claims are often spurious. 

The Uthgardt take their ritual practices and taboos 
very seriously. Most taboos and traditions vary from 
tribe to tribe, but at least one stricture is universal 
among the Uthgardt: magic other than that of the sha- 
mans or the magic of weapons and armor is forbidden. 

The priests of the Uthgardt revere their ancestor-god 
and also invoke the names of their totems as interces- 
sors with the Father of the Tribes. Their ethos is simple: 
strength is rewarded with more strength, and when 
strength fails, it is because a person is not worthy. 

Warlock’s Crypt 

On the western edge of the Troll Hills lies an area of 
bizarre terrain: shattered rubble is strewn across the 
landscape, between and among mounds of upturned 
earth and deep furrows of the sort one commonly sees 
in the wake of trebuchet blows that miss their mark. 
Farther in from the perimeter of this blasted land lies 
a scattered mess of buildings, some relatively intact, 
others half-collapsed and leaning on their neighbors. 

In the center, rising above it all, is a handful of twisted 
towers looking for all the world like talons clawing at 
the sky. These towers can be seen from a good distance, 
seemingly unharmed by the cataclysm that produced 
the damage around them. Indeed, because of their pris- 
tine condition, some folk conjecture that these towers 
must have been built after that event. 

The truth of the place now called Warlock’s Crypt 
is something different altogether. All of the structures 
visible here, from the now-shattered outbuildings to the 
central towers, comprised a city that floated atop a disc 
of stone during the time of ancient Netheril. When the 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 


ancient and wicked magics of the Netherese failed, this 
city plummeted from the sky; the chunks and slabs of 
stone scattered about the site are not natural terrain, but 
are the shards of that disc. 

My Only Visit 

I have been to the Warlocks Crypt but once, in the 
days of my youth before I knew better. I was hired by 
Daerismun Aerath, one of the Avowed— the esteemed 
scholar-monks of Candlekeep— to guide him there. He 
was writing a treatise on the place and desired firsthand 
experience of the locale. Fresh as I was from Evereska, 
I’d never heard the warnings of the wise regarding this 
site. I am either extraordinarily beloved of Solonor, or 
stupidly lucky, to have made it back out alive. Tragically, 
Daerismun was not so fortunate. 

As we approached, this ruined cityscape seemed 
uninhabited. Its expanse is fairly limited, and consists 
almost entirely of a mess of destroyed buildings and 
massive boulders. 

The central towers were apparently preserved by 
some aspect of their magical construction— which isn’t 
to say that they were entirely unaffected by the crash. 
Upon closer inspection, one of the central towers has a 
great crack running along its western edge, and several 
of the others display a degree of damage. 

As we came even closer to the towers, they appeared 
to be anything but abandoned. In their windows flick- 
ered occasional eldritch lights, and on their sides we 
could see indistinct shapes scampering across the sur- 
face. These buildings were crafted to appear as though 
clad in black mail, made of overlapping plates and 
slightly discordant, off-center architecture creating the 
impression of joints that might bend at any moment. 

The towers, joined in a rough circle by walls of smooth 
black stone, form a perimeter around the heart of the 
Crypt— which can be seen only from a terrifyingly close 
vantage. Obscured and protected by the towers are sev- 
eral strange plots of land: some barren, others overrun 
with twisted, thorny flora not found in nature. Rail-less 
bridges connect these towers at various points, and all 
of them spiral around the heart: that which is reputedly 
the demesne of the lich-king Larloch himself, who has 
also been called the Shadow King. 

Threats and Defenses 

I warn you: do not come to this place. And if you must, 
do not tarry, for its defenders are brutal and blood- 
thirsty, as inimical to life as any plague or poison, and 
they take delight in the suffering of those who come into 
their reach. 

This place is rife with undead, of all varieties. In 
addition to the Shadow King, the Crypt houses several 
other liches, undead sorcerous vassals to Larloch. He 
calls upon their power when he has need, but other- 
wise leaves them alone to conduct the experiments and 
plots he demands of them. Though he once bound their 
influence tightly, reports suggest he has begun giving 
them a greater lead on their leashes, for magical horrors 
that could well be the result of their experiments have 
been seen unleashed in the Troll Hills and Troll Forest 
around the ruins. 




Such monstrosities are also common prowling the 
ruins of the Crypt itself. During my brief sojourn into 
this place, I identified several creatures that likely 
began their lives as griffons, owlbears, trolls, and even 
a beholder, but they had become twisted and nearly 
unrecognizable. What it is these liches do to these crea- 
tures is a question for minds far more wise than mine— I 
know only that the first such abomination I fought 
nearly killed me, and I barely escaped from the others 
we sighted. 

The Crypt has defenses other than monsters, as 
well. My companion Daerismun asserted that it was 
protected with layers of “spell webs,” constructions of 
magical energy waiting to unleash spells against those 
who stumbled into them. I had the terrible opportunity 
to see one of them in action, when the Avowed scholar 
unknowingly breached one of those so-called webs 
and set off a ball of fire, which ignited with himself at 
its center. 

As one might imagine, this blast drew the attention 
of all manner of twisted predators and hungry undead, 
which came forth to investigate. I don’t know how these 
creatures kept from being caught in these traps, or if 
they had simply dwelt here long enough to know how to 
avoid them. Before I could give the matter any thought, I 
was forced to flee, and I don’t intend to ever return. 

Luskan 

Anyone who goes to Luskan should know about its 
ruling Ships and the Arcane Brotherhood. The Ships 
of Luskan have been described as bands of pirates, but 
that characterization misses how deeply ingrained the 
Ships are to the society of Luskan and the mentality of 
its citizens. Attack a Ship member and you might incur 
not just the wrath of the Ship, but of much of the city 
as well. As for the Arcane Brotherhood, one member of 
it may or may not come to another’s aid, but know that 
each of these egotistical mages is eager to prove his or 
her magical prowess, and none can afford to show weak- 
ness before the folk of Luskan. 

Luskan, the City of Sails, spans the icy River Mirar, 
which tumbles from the Spine of the World, races past 
Mirabar, and then plunges toward the sea. The swift 
river has cut deep here, and Luskan rests atop two 
escarpments on either side, with sheer, forty-foot bluffs 
of gray stone rising above the water. Around the city’s 
perimeter, thick stone walls with squat towers provide 
defense. The southern gate, called the Twin Teeth, 
boasts the most impressive towers, standing twice as 
tall as the city walls, and bedecked with crenellations 
and arrow slits enough for numerous defenders, in a 
show of strength toward the southern approach. 

The Ships 

Within the city walls and on the nearby waters, Luskan 
is ruled by its Ships and their five High Captains: 

• First High Captain Beniago Kurth 

• Second High Captain Barri Baram 

• Third High Captain Dagmaer Suljack 

• Fourth High Captain Throa Taerl 

• Fifth High Captain Hartouchen Rethnor

The five High Captains take the names of their Ships 
when they ascend to leadership. The captains are the 
highest authorities in Luskan; they and the members 
of their Ships conduct themselves as a sort of nobility, 
albeit one that isn’t hereditary. 

Despite the name, each Ship is not a single vessel, 
but an organization of stalwarts owing allegiance to one 
another and to their captain, whom they elect for life. To 
be a member of a Ship is a select privilege, one that only 
one in ten of Luskan’s residents can claim. 

The five Ships of Luskan are more than gangs of 
pirates. They are fellowships of people who live, train, 
work, make love, and go to war with each other. To join 
one is a mark of honor and continues a grand tradition 
that Luskar associate with democracy, self-determina- 
tion, and individuality. 

Each Ship has its own symbol and colors. Members 
of a Ship often wear their colors, decorate their round 
shields with the symbol and colors, and tattoo them- 
selves with the symbol. Like their Northlander relations, 
Luskar Ship members regularly tattoo their faces, but 
instead of representing their island, the tattoos are 
either personal marks or tattoos of their allegiance to 
their Ship. 

Membership in a Ship is voluntary, but once under- 
taken it is until death. To join a Ship, a Luskar must be 
of fighting age (fourteen or so, for humans), and possess 
at least one sword or axe, one spear, and three of the 
sturdy, bossed shields the Northlanders prefer. Each 
Ship accepts new candidates from time to time to fill 
vacancies caused by death, but as a rule, the Ships don’t 
expand their ranks by taking on a large number of new 
members at one time. 

Each Ship has some number of sailing vessels, the 
size, crew, and type of which help to determine the influ- 
ence of the Ship’s High Captain and its rank within the 
city. The current First Ship, Kurth, has so many vessels 
that it nearly outnumbers the next two Ships combined, 
and its membership is so numerous that Ships Suljack, 
Taerl, and Rethnor could merge and still not equal it. 

The laws of the city govern the behavior of the Ships 
and their captains, decreeing the Ships responsible for 
the city’s defense, its administration, and the manage- 
ment of its resources. Beyond these universal tasks, 
each captain takes on other duties as desired in order 
of that Ship’s standing in the hierarchy, leaving less

\ W 


glamorous and less lucrative tasks to the captains and 
Ships of lower rank. 

Since each of the Ships has the ability to take what it 
likes and leave what it doesn’t want to the lesser Ships, 
a strict division of duties has arisen among them. 

Ship Kurth controls the city’s docks and activity 
occurring thereupon. Among the most profitable of the 
merchandise that passes through the port are weapons 
and tools from Ironmaster, and ambergris for the per- 
fume trade. 

Ship Baram operates Luskan’s fishing industry. The 
food it provides is so vital to the city's welfare nowadays 
that Baram has risen to Second Ship on the strength of 
its successful forays out to sea. 

Ship Suljack holds sway over, and conducts most of, 
the piracy and raiding that originates out of Luskan. 

It occasionally passes the more meager opportunities 
down to Taerl. 

Ship Taerl, recently elevated from Fifth Ship, had 
been accustomed to taking the hindmost. Now its work- 
ers and sailors happily accept chances for profit handed 
down from above, and just as happily delegate the most 
menial and undesirable chores to Rethnor. 

Ship Rethnor engages in few worthwhile activities 
aside from guard duty, which is a poor source of income. 
Rethnor toughs sometimes roam the streets of Luskan, 
looking for a quick and perhaps violent way to grab 
some coin. 

People and Laws 

Without question, the people of Luskan show their 
Northlander heritage. They raid ships and coastal set- 
tlements, engage in interdiction and piracy, and value 
strength of arms above most other qualities. During 
Luskan’s long history on the Sword Coast, however, the 
city has adopted many of the attitudes of mainland folk. 
Luskar don’t kidnap people from other settlements or 
tribes, and they hold that women have social standing 
equal to men (two of the High Captains, Suljack and 
Taerl, are women). They don’t distrust magic, as their 
island brethren do. Slavery is, at least nominally, illegal 
in Luskan, though a slave taken and sold at sea is usu- 
ally overlooked by authorities. 

The law in Luskan is supposed to be upheld by 
soldiers of the Ships, who are empowered to arrest 
criminals and bring them before the Magistrates of the 
city. In practice, arrests are as often made by mobs, but 
the result is the same: an appearance before the Magis- 
trates. Each of the five Magistrates is chosen by a High 
Captain, but need not be a member of that captain’s 
Ship. The Magistrates are, at least officially, neutral. 
Most citizens have their cases decided by a single one of 
these judges, but a dispute involving a Ship member is 
heard by all five. 

Trade and Commerce 

Luskan doesn’t officially tax its citizens; the city makes 
its money through trade, fishing, piracy, and raiding. 

The defense of the city comes at the expense of the 
Ships, paid for by the profits of those activities as well as 
the protection money the Ships extort from businesses 
and homes to keep the thieves and gangs at bay. Bribery 








is a common practice, a seemingly accepted means of 
gaining the favor of one of the High Captains to obtain 
fishing rights, earning an advantageous decision from 
the Magistrates, or having a business rival or undesired 
suitor arrested, accosted, or roughed up. 

Given its status as the harbor that feeds the goods of 
Mirabar to the Sword Coast, bridging the coast with 
the utter north, and offers the only convenient crossing 
of the River Mirar for many miles, Luskan makes con- 
siderable coin as a crossroads. Merchants wishing to 
avoid Luskan can choose to use the Blackford Crossing, 
some thirty miles upstream, eventually connecting with 
the Blackford Road on the northern bank, but the savvy 
know that Luskan’s Ships control the cable-guided 
ferries at the crossing, and demand tolls based on the 
size and contents of the goods being ferried across. 

The Blackford Road still bears the ancient marks of the 
dwarven realm of Gharraghaur, reminding travelers of 
whose wealth sustains the region. 

North of the city, the Northern Means heads up 
toward Icewind Dale. Not many take this route without 
purpose, but scrimshaw from the dale finds its way into 
Luskan, where those who would purchase it can do so 
without going any farther into the frozen terrain. 


The north side of the city, known as North Bank, 
is devoted almost entirely to warehouses, caravan 
yards, and workspace. It includes the Mirabar Shield, 
the fortified compound that represents Mirabar’s 
trading interest in Luskan. Mirabar uses it as a base 
to trade with the Sword Coast and the islands of the 
Trackless Sea. 

The main city stands on the southern side of the River 
Mirar. North of Reaver’s Run is the Reach, where most 
of the homes and smaller businesses are located. South 
of the Run are the slums, the “bad” area of town. Near 
the slums is the Captain’s Close, where the residences 
of High Captains Taerl and Suljack stand, but the area is 
otherwise quite poor. 

The Islands 

Five islands stand in the bay formed by the River Mirar 
and are claimed by Luskan: 

• Blood Island is filled with Ships’ soldiers tasked with 
guarding the city; it holds a guard tower, barracks, an 
armory, and little else of interest. 

• Closeguard Island is the home of High Captain Kurth. 

• Cutlass Island has two rocky heights split by a peb- 
ble-strewn beach. The southern peak is surmounted 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 









by the Sea Tower, where Luskan’s first pirates built 
their stronghold, while the northern one is home to 
the Hosttower of the Arcane and the stables it shares 
with Ship Kurth. 

• Fang Island has no inhabitants, and is named for its 
propensity for destroying vessels swept down the 
River Mirar. 

• Harbor Arm Island is a tall spire sheltering Whitesails 
Harbor from the worst of the storms and waves that 
wash in from the south. 

The Bridges 

The North and South Banks are spanned by three 
bridges: the Upstream Span, from the South Bank 
straight to the North Gate; Dalath’s Span, the middle 
bridge with a name none can place in legend, and 
Harbor Cross, split between the Short Span that runs 
from the South Bank to Blood Island, and the Long 
Span that continues on to North Bank. Only Ship 
members and those authorized by a High Captain may 
traverse Harbor Cross. 

Dark Arch connects South Bank with Closeguard 
Island, and only members of Ship Kurth and the 
Arcane Brotherhood may cross that span unchallenged. 
The same is true of Sword Bridge, which crosses 
from Closeguard Island to Cutlass Island. Although 
Closeguard Island is officially unguarded, it’s still true 
that only members of the Arcane Brotherhood or Ship 
Kurth are expected to be there, so anyone out of place is 
aggressively questioned about their presence. 

The Arcane Brotherhood 

In the last decade or so, two great changes have come 
over Luskan. The first was the plague that crippled the 
gangs that had controlled the city, allowing the High 
Captains to reclaim the power they had long held in 



Luskan. The other, far more sudden, was the return of 
the Arcane Brotherhood and its five-spired tower. A few 
years ago, the ruined Hosttower of the Arcane began 
regenerating its damaged stone, climbing into the sky 
once more. Shortly thereafter, mages of the Arcane 
Brotherhood emerged, almost immediately began 
cleansing the Luskar ruins of undead, and fought off 
a dragon menacing the city. Cheered by the citizens, 
they swore to keep themselves out of the politics of the 
High Captains and the city at large, but the notion that 
powerful wizards closely aligned with one another can 
truly remain neutral is laughable to anyone familiar with 
such things. 

Now, the Arcane Brotherhood again walks the streets 
of Luskan, marked by the distinctive colors and patterns 
of their cloaks. From a distance, these cloaks all bear 
the same cut and silhouette, but each wizard of the 
Hosttower chooses a color or a design, and a moniker 
to match it. The leadership of the Arcane Brotherhood 
is the archmage and the four overwizards of the other 
spires of the Hosttower: 

• Cashaan the Red, Archmage Arcane 

• Zelenn the White, Overwizard of the West 

• Jendrick the Blue, Overwizard of the South 

• Teyva the Gray, Overwizard of the East 

• Druette the Raven, Overwizard of the North 

Other notable members of the Brotherhood include 
Vaelish the Brown and Maccath the Crimson. 

Icewind Dale 

Go far enough north, and you will come to the moun- 
tains rightly called the Spine of the World. Turn west 
and go toward the Sea of Moving Ice, and you might 
eventually come upon one of the scattered communities 
of Icewind Dale. You can also travel up the ever-narrow- 
ing road from Luskan called the Northern Means, and 
eventually come upon the frozen tundra beyond. 

Why travel so far? Well, if you’re like many who’ve 
drifted up there from the south, it is because an easier 
life doesn’t suit you, you’re running from something, or 
you just don’t fit in anywhere else. 

Ten-Towns 

Coming up the hard road from the south, the first thing 
you’ll see is Kelvin’s Cairn, a great mountain scarred 
by a crack down its southwestern face. Even in high 
summer, its peak is capped in snow and ice. In the 
mountain’s southern shadow is Bryn Shander, the larg- 
est, most populous, and most fortified of the Ten-Towns 
of Icewind Dale. Ten-Towns is a grouping of communi- 
ties clustered around the three lakes of the area: Maer 
Dualdon, from which the Shaengarne River flows down 
toward Ironmaster; Lac Dinneshere to the east, whose 
waters are nearly always cold enough to kill; and Red- 
waters, named for an old battle between rival fisherfolk 
that left the waters bloody. 

Ten-Towns thrives on fishing and trade, both endeav- 
ors reliant on the knucklehead trout of Icewind Dale’s 
lakes. Without these fish, the people of Ten-Towns 
would starve, but there would also be little for them to 
barter or sell. The ivory-like bones of these fish are the 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 


basis of the famous scrimshaw that is sold as far south 
as Calimshan and farther east than I care to consider. 
The bones are also used to make all manner of small, 
sturdy tools: fish hooks, arrowheads, sewing needles, 
buttons, and more. Each town on the lakes has its own 
fleet of fishing boats, and the towns carefully divide the 
lakes to protect the population and the delicate balance 
between the communities. 

Independent-minded folk who come to Ten-Towns are 
discouraged from striking out on their own, and when 
they do, they often fail, either due to the dangers of the 
waters, being blocked out of the best fishing areas, or 
simply being refused trade by the scrimshanders, whose 
wares are expensive. Icewind Dale is a place where 
cooperation is essential for survival, and ignoring that 
fact can leave one quite alone in a time of need. 

Where nine of the Ten-Towns survive primarily on 
fishing, Bryn Shander lives on trade, making it the place 
to visit when you come here. The walls keep the town 
safe from barbarians who raid the area and the beasts 
of the tundra, and the packing in of its people means 
Bryn Shander is also warmer than the other towns, both 
literally and in terms of the welcome you receive. 

I have visited only a few of the other towns, and while 
they have their quirks and charms, they are mostly what 
you might expect: fishing villages at the edge of frigid 
waters in a frozen waste. Certainly, there is trade to be 
done, coin to be made, and intrigue to be investigated 
in even in the smallest of these communities (which 
can number as few as a hundred souls). The only other 
point of interest is the town of Targos, on Maer Dualdon, 
which has grown rapidly and is threatening to burst 
the bounds of its protective wall, and thus has a hum of 
opportunity about it. 

Reghed Barbarians 

Ten-Towns isn't the only community in Icewind Dale. 
Tribes of human barbarians called Reghed also operate 
in the area. Hunters and raiders who value strength and 
devotion to their ancestral heroes, they claim a great 
many heroes among their honored dead, including some 
who were responsible for the safety of Ten-Towns, Ice- 
wind Dale, and beyond. A Reghed camp is made up of 
a large ring of hide tents, able to be broken down and 
transported as the Reghed move to keep up with the 
herds of reindeer they depend on for food and clothing. 

The Dwarves 

Dwarves still live in the mines of Kelvin’s Cairn, but in 
fewer numbers than they once did, and with less influ- 
ence than they had on the rest of Icewind Dale a century 
or two ago. The dwarves here claim their continued 
allegiance to Clan Battlehammer of Mithral Hall, even 
though they returned to the colder north when they dis- 
covered their ancient home no longer suited them. Bryn 
Shander serves them as a trading post, allowing them 
to keep humans and other strangers away from their 
mines, which are some distance away in the shadow 
of the Cairn. The dwarves send a representative to the 
council of speakers that governs Ten-Towns, but have no 
say in their proceedings except to declare acceptance or 
refusal of the decisions of the human gathering. 


The Underdark 

Do YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE A SLAVE? TO FEEL THE 

crack of a whip, the venom of a drow priestess's snake -headed 
lash, the weight of a burdenyou can't possibly lift after so 
much toil? No, you don't. So close your mouth and openyour 
eyes and ears, and dipyour quill. 

— Oshgir the half-ore, to Kimitar Thaeless, 

glyphscribe of Deneir 

Known by many as the Realms Below, the vast, miles- 
deep network of caverns, caves, and underground 
waterways called the Underdark is home to many 
strange creatures and even stranger societies. No one 
is quite sure the extent of this massive ecosystem, 
except to say that it reaches at least the breadth of the 
continent, and that most creatures are fully capable of 
surviving their entire lives within it, provided they can 
find enough food and safety to do so. Breathable air is 
plentiful, and clean water can be found. Beyond that, 
most surface folk only have the tales of adventurers, the 
survivors of attacks, and the occasional escaped captive 
to describe the horrors lurking below the surface. 

What follows are portions of the tale told by Oshgir, a 
half-ore warrior who was captured by a duergar raiding 
party, sold to a Zhentarim agent, captured by drow, and 
then escaped his captivity by killing an overseer and 
fleeing to Blingdenstone. This account was recorded by 
a traveling scribe of Deneir named Kimitar Thaeless 
and submitted to the library at Candlekeep. Most don’t 
believe that a half-ore was quite so eloquent in his tell- 
ing, and thus contend that the scribe embellished the 
tale somewhat. 

Capture 

It’s impossible to describe the shame of a hardened 
warrior driven to his knees by a half-dozen duergar that 
have just slain his fellows. Never mind that we were 
asleep and unarmored at the time, or that I was able to 
take four of them down before an axe cut the strength 
from my leg. I was shackled and gagged, my wound 
wrapped in a bandage tight enough to stop the bleeding 
and numb my leg. as the gray pests laughed and spouted 
jokes at me, and then forced me to walk until I lost con- 
sciousness. When next I awoke, there was no longer a 
sky overhead. 

Gracklstugh 

After days of walking in the deep, dark places beneath 
the surface, I was led, in heavy chains, to Gracklstugh, 
on the shores of the Darklake. I was set to work almost 
immediately at a forge, to pump bellows, heft ingots, 
and carry barrels of quenching oil. The place is called 
the City of Blades, for good reason: the fine steel of the 
duergar is impressive, considering the quality of the iron 
they were starting with. Hammering, refining, and care- 
ful polishing gave the metal the strength and sleekness 
necessary, and diligent sharpening added wicked edges 
to many of the blades I handled. 


CHAPTER 2 I THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 



The duergar make their homes mainly beyond a great 
wall, which I never passed through. To the north, the 
floor of the cavern that contains the Darklake hovers 
dangerously low, such that in some places it is barely 
ten feet above the waters surface. The whole of the 
great cavern glows, and the continuous flow of hot iron 
through the city gives the illumination a yellow cast at 
all times. It is frightening, if you forget where you are. 
More than that, it is hot. 

After a month or so of working under a minor smith, 

I quarreled with the apprentice set to supervise me, 
and he dared me to test the strength of his new blade. 

It broke, as I expected, but did the job well enough. The 
duergar didn’t seem to be angry that the apprentice lay 
dead at my feet, but it was only a short time thereafter 
that I was dragged off to the market to be sold. As it 
happened, a human was in the city on some diplomatic 
mission. I caught his eye, and he purchased me. 

Mantol-Derith 

I soon learned that I was not bought entirely for my 
brute strength, but also for what knowledge I had of 
the duergar. My new owner was a member of some 
group he called the Zhentarim, and when I told him all 
I knew, he offered me my freedom and a place among 
his agents. Together we would journey to a place called 
Mantol-Derith, where I would serve as his bodyguard. 
From there we would go to the surface, and I could 
remain in his employ if I wished. Freedom and a job? 
How could I refuse? 

Mantol-Derith is a hidden place accessed by secret 
ways. Slaves, such as I had been, are typically not per- 
mitted to go there. Once in the cavern, I had to remain 
near my employer, but by keeping my eyes and ears 
open, I learned a lot about this place. 

Mantol-Derith is where duergar, drow, and svirfneblin 
come to trade with each other and with surface-dwellers 
interested in conducting business with the deep places. 
Its location is kept secret— I only know that it is fairly 
close to the Darklake. The drow sell weapons, armor, 
magic scrolls and potions, and fine works of art. The 
duergar trade mainly in fine steel, and demand high 
prices to do so. Deep gnomes come to market with 
gems, certain fungi only they are capable of growing, 
and salt, which much of the Underdark has little ready 
supply of. The surface folk bring wines, ales, and spirits, 
cloth, wood, paper, and a great many other goods. 

The laws of Mantol-Derith don’t seem to care about 
anything other than commerce. There must be no prohi- 
bition on what sorts of creatures can visit here— among 
other things, I saw a pair of mind flayer envoys doing 
business in the market. The most serious of crimes are 
theft, the use of magic to influence negotiations, and the 
counterfeiting of goods by mundane or magical means. 
Anyone discovered to be in violation is sentenced on 
the spot, wrapped in heavy chains, and carted off to be 
tossed to the bottom of the Darklake. 

When my employer’s business was concluded, he was 
true to his word, and we left for the surface. If only the 
drow with whom he did business were so trustworthy. 
We were ambushed, he was killed, and I was again put 
in chains. 









Menzoberranzan 

I eventually got away from the place, but not before I 
had learned more about Menzoberranzan than any 
sane person would care to know. Although the life of 
a slave can be brutally short in the City of Spiders, the 
drow aren’t so extravagant that they do away with every 
captive they take. At the same time, they are masters 
of punishment— it is fear of pain, not fear of death, that 
motivates the slaves of drow. If you’re lucky, you’ll only 
feel normal shackles and the occasional whip or light 
spell-blast. A bit less luck or more malice, and the ser- 
pent-headed whips of the priestesses come out. 

If you aren’t a drow in the City of Spiders, you aren’t 
worth a name. All manner of surface-dwellers— ores and 
elves, humans and halflings— are brought here to serve 
as slaves to the drow in their refuge. The constant fear 
of punishment, from one’s mistress or another, more 
powerful drow, keeps most slaves obedient, even when 
they aren’t directly supervised. 

The great cavern of the city is filled with tall spires, 
and homes both great and small are carved into the sta- 
lagmites and stalactites that pierce the darkness. Gentle 
illumination from magic or glowing fungus decorates 
some homes and businesses, as well as the mansions of 
the high houses of the city, eight of which have positioned 
themselves above all others. While the lesser houses 
dance and fight and scheme for advantages over each 
other, they all live under the heel of House Baenre and 
the Matron Mother, who rules the city in Lolth’s name. 

On a large plateau high above the cavern floor is Tier 
Breche, also called the Academy, where the city trains 
its priestesses, mages, and noble warriors. The city’s 
market is centrally located, and rothe are raised on an 
isle toward the eastern edge of the city. 

If you are ever so unfortunate as to be enslaved by the 
drow of Menzoberranzan, my advice to you is simple 
and stern: do as you are commanded, avoid insulting 
their goddess (which means don’t even brush off a 
spider crawling on you), and attempt escape only if you 
are desperate or sure of your survival. If you are given 
the proper opportunity, as I was, you might discover that 
the neck of a drow snaps with surprising ease. 

Escape 

One day, well after I had lost count of how many days 
I’d been a captive, I was in a small outlying cavern with 
a few other slaves harvesting a mushroom patch. I was 
given leave to answer nature’s call away from the mush- 
rooms, and I lingered long enough in a side tunnel to 
force my watcher to come and find me. I took the first 
lash he offered me with his whip, then grabbed the 
weapon and pulled the skinny fool toward me before he 
could sound an alarm or get his blade out. It took me 
but a second to get both hands around his throat. When 
he lay dead at my feet, I took his sword and ran as fast 
and far as I could. I knew the gnomish city of Blingden- 
stone was nearby, and I came upon it eventually, but the 
journey took days as I wound through convoluted pas- 
sageways and tried to avoid notice. 


Blingdenstone 

My initial joy at reaching Blingdenstone was quickly tem- 
pered. The deep gnomes don’t seem to like visitors they 
can’t recognize or identify, and being a half-ore didn’t help 
matters in the least for me. After dodging arrows loosed 
from the high walls of the city, I gave up on going through 
the gate and snuck in through a small cart tunnel, empty- 
ing out part of a load of ore to make room for myself. 

I managed to avoid conflict with the guards that dis- 
covered me in the cart. When they ordered me to stand, 

I did so with my weapon held at my side, and I turned to 
display my back to them. When they saw that it was cov- 
ered in lashes and the scars of the priestesses’ fanged 
whips, and they realized that my blade was of drow man- 
ufacture (though I clearly was not), they were willing to 
believe my story. 

Though the gnomes kept me under watch, I was allowed 
to regain my strength for a few days, and I saw a bit of 
their community in the meantime. Once I was inside the 
city, I could tell that it’s not much of a city at all. The svir- 
fneblin all live in close contact with one another, and this 
togetherness can be disconcerting, especially for someone 
accustomed to small luxuries like shutters on windows 
and doors on privies. The homes are all smoothed-over 
natural stone, with little evidence of hard corners. 

Each industry has a portion of the city to itself: trad- 
ing, smithing, mining, and the growing of a special 
fungus crop. Still many of the old tunnels and caverns 
remain unclaimed and sealed off, whether to guard 
against invasion or perhaps because of what now dwells 
there, I don’t know. 

If you're welcomed long enough to the city, you can 
trade for fine goods and armor here; the gnomes’ 
chain mail and mining picks seem most worth acquir- 
ing. Before sending me on my way, the gnomes were 
kind enough to give me a pick, a dagger, and some of 
their trillimac, an odd fungus that can be made into 
something like bread. It’s a bit spongy, but it doesn’t 
spoil quickly, and it got me to the surface before I 
starved to death. 


The Cavern of Menzoberranzan 

Menzoberranzan fills a large vault that was formerly a 
lair of giant spiders and beholders. The vault is known by 
its dwarven name, Araurilcaurak (“Great Pillar Cavern”), 
because of Narbondel, the giant rock pillar at the vault’s 
center that joins floor and ceiling. The cavern is roughly 
shaped like an arrowhead, with the pool of Donigarten at 
its tip, and stretching two miles across at its widest point. 
The ceiling rises a thousand feet high, and the floor is 
studded with stalagmites. 

Two areas rise above the rest of the city: Tier Breche, the 
side cavern occupied by the Academy where most drow cit- 
izens are trained for adulthood; and the larger Qu’ellarz’orl 
(or House-Loft), a plateau that is home to many of the 
city’s mightiest noble houses, separated from the lower 
city by a forest of giant mushrooms. From either of these 
heights, a surveyor can view the city. The view shows rows 
of spired stone castles, their sculpted highlights lit by the 
soft, tinted flows of permanent faerie fire lights. 


CHAPTER 2 | THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 












Chapter 3: Races of the Realms 


aerOn is home to many races, some of 
them immigrants from other worlds who 
found their way here in ancient times when 
gates and portals were more plentiful, 
and easier to traverse. Others are relative 
newcomers to the world, still finding a 
place for themselves among the long- 
established races. The civilizations of the elder races 
have declined, while those of the younger races are 
flourishing and spreading ever outward. 

The character races described in the Player's Hand- 
book are all found in the Realms, along with some 
subraces unique to Faerun. Each character race has all 
the traits of the primary race, as given in the Player's 
Handbook , plus traits for each subrace that are unique 
to those individuals. This chapter provides racial traits 
for a subrace only when they differ from or replace those 
given in the Player's Handbook. The information in this 
chapter is specific to the Realms, so if something stated 
here differs from what’s presented in the Player's Hand- 
book this material takes precedence. 

Dwarves 

The Stout Folk are deliberate and steadfast, with a 
proud history as great artisans, builders, and warriors. 
Although the glory of their empires faded long ago, the 
dwarves still hold to their ancient ways and traditions. 
They stubbornly defend what remains of their old do- 
mains beneath hill and mountain, and some seek to 
reclaim what they have lost to the depredations of ores, 
goblins, and the inexorable march of time. 

According to their own legends, dwarves were formed 
from iron, mithral, earth, and stone on the Soulforge of 
Moradin. After the All-Father breathed life into them in 
the heart of the world, dwarves found their way to the 
surface and, from there, spread across each continent. 

Thousands of years of settlement and separation 
divided the dwarves into distinct subraces: the shield 
dwarves, most common in the North and the Sword 
Coast; the gold dwarves of the southern lands; and the 
gray dwarves, or duergar, of the Underdark. 

The Dwarvish language of Faerun uses a runic alpha- 
bet called Dethek, whose characters are easy to etch 
into stone and metal, as evidenced by the runestones 
and way-markers found in ancient dwarven tunnels 
and mines. 

Shield Dwarves 

The ancestral home of the shield dwarves is in northern 
Faerun, where ancient dwarfholds exist in the North, 
Damara, Impiltur, Vaasa, the Vast, and the Western 
Heartlands. The most famous of the old shield dwarf 
cities is Citadel Adbar, north and east of Silverymoon. 
Many of these dwarfholds have changed hands over the 
centuries in a cycle of invasion by enemies, followed by 
reconquest by the dwarves. 

Living in a near-constant state of war for generations, 
shield dwarves are a hardy people, slow to trust, with 


long memories and often an equally long list of griev- 
ances against their ancient enemies. The more conser- 
vative among them want to maintain the traditions and 
remaining holdings of their people, isolated from the in- 
fluence of outsiders and safe from invaders behind thick 
walls of stone. Shield dwarves of a more adventurous 
bent are interested in exploring the world and seeing 
what lies beyond the bounds of their ancient dwarfholds. 

Shield dwarves have the racial traits of mountain 
dwarves in the Player’s Handbook. Their skin is usu- 
ally fair, eyes green, hazel, or silver-blue, and they have 
brown, blond, or red hair. Full beards and mustaches 
are commonly seen on male shield dwarves. 

Shield dwarves are renowned artisans, particularly in 
metal and stone. They tend to focus more on sturdiness 
in their craft than on the artistic flourishes and gilding 
favored by their gold dwarf cousins. Shield dwarf craft- 
ers build to last, and each one’s signature mark placed 
upon an enduring masterpiece serves as a way of gain- 
ing immortality. 

Gold Dwarves 

Gold dwarves are common in the lands to the south and 
east. They are formidable warriors, proud of their long 
traditions, with strong ties to clan. They are gruff and 
haughty and have a love of fine craftsmanship and an 
eagerness to trade. 

Significant settlements of gold dwarves exist in the 
Great Rift, the area surrounding the Dragon Coast, 
as well as in the Old Empires of eastern Faerun. 

Smaller communities are found in the Smoking Moun- 
tains, in the Giant’s Run Mountains, and the Western 
Heartlands. 

Because they have not endured the same cycle of 
invasion and displacement, gold dwarves tend to be 
more optimistic than their shield dwarf cousins, but 
they’re still standoffish and prideful as only a dwarf 
can be. They believe their race’s stable history is the 
result of their attentiveness to tradition, and have little 
doubt that the future of the gold dwarves will be just 
as peaceful, if they remain true to their customs and 
principles. 


Dwarf Clans of the North 

All dwarves count their clan heritage as an important part 
of their lineage and identity. While in some cities a single 
clan dominates (or is the only one in residence), in other 
dwarven communities there is a complex relationship be- 
tween family, clan, and the larger society. 

Some of the dwarf clans in the North are Arnskull, 
Battlehammer, Blackbanner, Blackhammer, Bucklebar, 
Darkfell, Deepaxe, Deepdelve, Eaglecleft, Foehammer, 
Gallowglar, Hillsafar, Horn, Ironshield, Jundeth, Narlagh, 
Orothiar, Quarrymaster, Rockfist, Sstar, Stoneshaft, Stone- 
shield, Stoneshoulder, Trueforger, Watchever, Worldthrone, 
Wyrmslayer, and Yund. 

Some dwarves hail from the family that founded or rules 
a given clan, and so they use the clan name as their family 
name. Others are simply “of” the clan, but bear the clan 
name with as much pride as their own surnames. 



CHAPTER 3 | RACES OF THE REALMS 



Gold dwarves have the racial traits of hill dwarves in 
the Players Handbook. They are stocky and muscular, 
averaging about 4 feet tall, with brown skin, black or 
brown hair, and brown or hazel eyes, with green eyes 
rare (and considered lucky). Males grow full beards that 
they keep oiled and well groomed, and both genders 
wear their hair long and often elaborately braided. 

Gold dwarves are best known for crafting beautiful 
objects. According to them, all the natural resources of 
the world exist for mortals to turn them into objects of 
great beauty. Gold dwarves don’t want the most of every- 
thing; they want the best. Their artisans toil over items 
for years, getting their etchings and fine details just right 
before being satisfied with their efforts. 

That deliberate, perfectionist approach is a reflec- 
tion of gold dwarf culture, in which there is a right and 
proper way to do everything. Tradition dictates every as- 
pect of a gold dwarfs life, from one’s place in society, to 
prospects for marriage, to what careers are acceptable. 
Gold dwarves who take up a life of adventuring, away 
from the clan, rarely forsake their traditions when doing 
so. Even though they might have to live as outsiders for 
a time, they hope to ultimately improve their standing in 
their society. 

Gray Dwarves (Duergar) 


The gray dwarves, or duergar, live deep in the Un- 
derdark. After delving deeper than any other dwarves, 
they were enslaved by mind flayers for eons. Although 
they eventually won their freedom, these grim, ash- 
en-skinned dwarves now take slaves of their own and 
are as tyrannical as their former masters. 


Physically similar to other dwarves in some ways, du- 
ergar are wiry and lean, with black eyes and bald heads, 
with the males growing long, unkempt, gray beards. 

Duergar value toil above all else. Showing emotions 
other than grim determination or wrath is frowned on 
in their culture, but they can sometimes seem joyful 
when at work. They have the typical dwarven apprecia- 
tion for order, tradition, and impeccable craftsmanship, 
but their goods are purely utilitarian, disdaining aes- 
thetic or artistic value. 

Few duergar become adventurers, fewer still on the 
surface world, because they are a hidebound and sus- 
picious race. Those who leave their subterranean cities 
are usually exiles. Check with your Dungeon Master to 
see if you can play a gray dwarf character. 

Duergar Subrace Traits 

The duergar subrace has the dwarf traits in the Player's 
Handbook , plus the subrace traits below. 

Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score in- 
creases by 1. 

Superior Darkvision. Your darkvision has a radius 
of 120 feet. 

Extra Language. You can speak, read, and write 
Undercommon. 

Duergar Resilience. You have advantage on saving 
throws against illusions and against being charmed or 
paralyzed. 

Duergar Magic. When you reach 3rd level, you can 
cast the enlarge/reduce spell on yourself once with this 
trait, using only the spell’s enlarge option. When you 
reach 5th level, you can cast the invisibility spell on 
yourself once with this trait. You don’t need material 
components for either spell, and you can’t cast them 
while you’re in direct sunlight, although sunlight has no 
effect on them once cast. You regain the ability to cast 
these spells with this trait when you finish a long rest. 
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells. 

Sunlight Sensitivity. You have disadvantage on attack 
rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on 
sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever 
you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight. 

Dwarven Deities 

The gods of the dwarves are a pantheon, or clan, collec- 
tively known as the Morndinsamman. 

Forge Father and Revered Mother 

Moradin, the Soulforger, leads the dwarven gods. 

Known as Dwarf-father or All-Father, he is the god 
of the dwarf people as a whole, as well as the god of 
creation, “dwarf-crafts” (smithing and stonework), and 
protection. His wife is the Revered Mother, Berronar 
Truesilver, goddess of hearth and home, of honesty and 
faithfulness, and of oaths, loyalty, and honor. 

Gods of Battle 

Clangeddin Silverbeard is the dwarven god of war and 
valor. Gorm Gulthyn, also called Fire Eyes and the Lord 
of the Bronze Mask, is the god of defense and vigilance, 
the protector of dwarves. Haela Brightaxe is the god- 
dess of luck in battle, and the patron of dwarf fighters.

Dethek, the Letters and Numerals of Dwarvish 




Gods of Craft 

Dumathoin, the Keeper of Secrets under the Mountain, 
is the patron of the shield dwarves, as well as the god 
of buried wealth, mining, gems, and exploration, and 
the guardian of the dead. Sharindlar, Lady of Life and 
Mercy, is the goddess of healing, romantic love, and fer- 
tility, often associated with the moon. 

Gods of Far Places 

The god of invention and discovery is Dugmaren Bright- 
mantle, called the Wandering Tinker or the Gleam 
in the Eye. Marthammor Duin is the traveler’s god, 
patron of expatriates and guides, and deity of lightning 
and roads. 

Gods of Wealth 

Vergadain, called the Merchant King, is the god of 
thieves (who commands his followers never to steal 
from other dwarves), luck, and chance, as well as com- 
merce and negotiation. Abbathor is the god of greed, 
sometimes portrayed as a dragon filled with envy of the 
wealth of others, who jealously tends his own hoard. 

Gods of Evil 

Laduguer is the patron of the duergar, god of magic and 
those crafts not governed by Moradin. Also worshiped 
among the duergar is Deep Duerra, a goddess of con- 
quest and of the powers of the mind. 

Elves 

Skilled in both magic and warfare, the Tel'Quessir — “the 
People,” as they call themselves— came to Faerun ages 
ago, building vast and powerful empires long before the 
rise of humans. The days of the great elven nations are 
now long past, and many elves have withdrawn from the 
world into isolated sylvan realms, or set sail across the 
Trackless Sea to the isle of Evermeet. 

Unlike dwarves, who developed subraces in the 
world, elves brought their divisions with them, settling 
into separate kingdoms by type. Beings of immense 
power, the first elves explored and settled the world, 
bringing about a golden age of art, magic, and civi- 
lization. At the height of their power, the elves per- 
formed a High Magic ritual intended to create the ideal 
homeland. They succeeded, but the spell sundered 
the land in a terrible cataclysm at the same time that 



it caused the distant isle of Evermeet to rise from be- 
neath the sea. 

Then came the Crown Wars, a series of conflicts be- 
tween the great elven kingdoms lasting three thousand 
years. These battles devastated much of the world and 
resulted in the dark elves’ flight into the Underdark. 

Reeling from these calamities, the elven empires went 
into a long, slow decline, and many of their kind took 
part in the great Retreat to their refuge on Evermeet. As 
the elves increasingly withdrew from the world, other 
races and civilizations rose to prominence in Faerun. 

The Elvish language used across Faerun— sometimes 
called the True Tongue by elves— is written in the grace- 
ful script of the Espruar alphabet. Seldruin, the ancient 
language of elven High Magic that uses the Hamarfae 
alphabet, is all but forgotten nowadays. 

Moon Elves 

Also called silver elves, or TeuTe/’Quess/r, moon elves 
are more tolerant and adventurous than elves of other 
sorts. In ancient times, the dissolution of their empires 
dispersed moon elves among other races, and since 
then they have traditionally gotten along well with their 
non-elf neighbors. They mingle with other people while 
their kin remain in hidden settlements and secluded 
strongholds. 





CHAPTER 3 | RACES OF THE REALMS 








Moon elves are sometimes seen as frivolous, espe- 
cially by other elves. But it is the easygoing, fluid nature 
of their culture, philosophy, and personality that has 
enabled them to survive and flourish during and after 
tragic times in elven history. While communities of 
moon elves can be found in mainland Faerun, many 
moon elves live in the settlements of other races, staying 
for a few seasons or several decades before moving on. 

To a moon elf, home can be among the members of 
one’s family, clan, or other friends and loved ones. Moon 
elves who temporarily take up residence in or near sun 
elf communities aren’t shy about expressing the opinion 
that their kin need to be less serious. In turn, the sun 
elves pretend to be more annoyed by their moon elf 
neighbors than they truly are, provided that the moon 
elves’ whims and adventuresome urges don’t cause 
serious disruption. Given that the moon elves usually 
move on before wearing out their welcome, such unrest 
rarely occurs. 

Moon elves have the racial traits of high elves in the 
Player’s Handbook. They have pale skin with a bluish 
tint. Their hair runs the gamut of human colors, and 
some moon elves have hair of silvery white or various 
shades of blue. Their eyes are blue or green and have 
gold flecks. 

Given the race’s love of travel, exploration, and new 
experiences, many moon elves become adventurers, uti- 
lizing their talents for warfare, woodcraft, and wizardry 
in different measures. 

Sun Elves 

Sun elves, also known as gold elves, or Ar'Tel’Ques- 
s/r, have a reputation for being arrogant and 
self-important. Many of them believe they are 
Corellon’s chosen people and that other races— even 
other elves— are subordinate to them in skill, signifi- 
cance, and sophistication. They claim the title of “high 
elves” with pride, and indeed their race is responsible 
for great, and sometimes terrible, achievements. 

Recalling and emphasizing the glorious aspects of 
their history, sun elves subscribe to the principle of 
“elven excellence”— no matter how interesting, excep- 
tional, heroic, or noteworthy other races’ accomplish- 
ments might be, there is an inherent superiority to all 
things elven. This attitude colors sun elves’ relations 
with other elves, whom they see as diluted or dimin- 
ished representatives of elven culture. Some sun elves 
reject this way of thinking, but it is common enough 
that when most folk of Faerun see a sun elf, they see 
arrogance personified. Their haughty attitude can over- 
shadow the fact that most sun elves are also tirelessly 
compassionate and thoughtful champions of good. 

Sun elves have the racial traits of high elves in the 
Players Handbook. Sun elves have bronze skin. Their 
eyes are black, metallic gold, or metallic silver, and their 
hair is black, metallic copper, or golden blond. 

Sun elf culture and civilization is highly magical in 
nature, thanks to the race’s many accomplished wiz- 
ards, sages, and crafters. Not every sun elf is a skilled 
practitioner of the Art, but each one has at least a bit of 
inherent magic. Many sun elves mix magic with other 
art forms, which produces the complex dance of the 


Rare Elf Subraces 

Other lines of descendants exist of the elves who originally 
came to Faerun, but they are so rare as to be legendary, 
often considered mythical. 

Avariel. The Aril’Tel’Quessir, or winged elves, were among 
the first to settle in Faerun. They are famed for their 
feathered wings and ability to fly. Ancient conflicts with 
dragons nearly wiped them out, and today they are rarely, if 
ever, seen. 

Lythari. The Ly’Tel’Quessir have the ability to polymorph 
into wolves. Unlike werewolves, lythari don’t have a hybrid 
form and aren’t afflicted by a curse. They dwell together 
in secretive packs, primarily in wolf form, living free in the 
deep wilds of the world. 

Sea Elves. The Alu’Tel’Quessir (“water elves”) are an 
aquatic subrace of elves found in the oceans of the world, 
especially off the shores of Faerun and Evermeet. Sea 
elves live along the Sword Coast in close-knit nomadic 
clans, but elsewhere sea elves claim kingdoms in sun- 
lit shallows. They have been at war with the sahuagin 
throughout their history. 

Star Elves. The star elves, or Ruar’Tel’Quessir, look 
much like tall moon elves. They dwell on the demiplane 
of Sildeyuir near the Feywild. A conflict with the nilshai, 
a race of wormlike sorcerers from the Ethereal Plane, 
forced some star elves to leave their home and come 
to Faerun. 

Wild Elves. The Sy'Tel’Quessir are considered by many 
elves to be the most strange of their race, having aban- 
doned or lost much of their ancient culture. 


bladesingers as well as the enchanting music of their 
bards and the meticulous craftwork of their artisans. 
Sun elf adventurers often bring a feeling of noblesse 
oblige to their profession: they venture out into the world 
to challenge its dangers because someone must, and 
who could be better suited? 

Wood Elves 

Also called copper elves, or Sy’Tel’Quessir wood elves 
are the most common elves remaining in Faerun. Their 
ancestors left behind the strife of the Crown Wars mil- 
lennia ago to found strongholds and settlements deep in 
the forests. Today, most wood elves stand guard over the 
ruins of the past, believing it their duty to preserve their 
fallen glory as an object lesson of the dangers of hubris. 

Wood elves tend to be hardier than other elves, 
more solid and grounded than their cousins. This atti- 
tude is reflected in their culture and traditions; wood 
elves tend more toward physical pursuits than do 
other elves, and they view ancient elven history with a 
more critical eye. To the wood elves, the “great” elven 
kingdoms were responsible for many equally great 
mistakes. They look upon the Sundering, the Crown 
Wars, the descent of the drow, and other calamities as 
the result of acts of arrogance on the part of their an- 
cestors. Living around and amid the reminders of this 
arrogance, and standing witness to the rise and fall of 
many elven empires, wood elves see the place of elves in 
the world differently than moon or sun elves do. Wood 
elves seek a quiet harmony, not domination, with the 
wider world. 

Sylvan counterparts of the sun elves and moon 
elves, wood elves eschew the cities and strongholds of 


CHAPTER 3 | RACES OF THE REALMS 


their kin in favor of living close to nature. Wood elves 
have not claimed a large realm of their own since the 
kingdom of Eaerlann was destroyed millennia ago. 
Instead they maintain a number of smaller settlements, 
the better to keep those communities hidden or pro- 
tected. Wood elves claim territory in the High Forest, 
the Great Dale, the Western Heartlands, and beyond. 
Some wood elves live in other elven communities 
and territories, where they serve as scouts, rangers, 
and hunters. 

Despite seeing themselves as part of the world, wood 
elves don’t commonly emerge from their homes to 
encounter non-elves. Likewise, in the deep woods and 
forests of the world, most wood elves don’t come across 
members of other races. Adventurers, diplomats, couri- 
ers, and those who pursue similar professions are the 
exceptions, traveling far outside their sylvan domains 
and meeting a wide variety of folk. 

Wood elves in Faerun have the racial traits of wood 
elves in the Players Handbook. They have tan or 
coppery skin, with hair of wood brown, golden blond, 
black, or a shining metallic copper, and eyes of green, 
brown, or hazel. 

Skilled naturalists, wood elves often take up profes- 
sions that allow them to remain close to the wild or to 
make use of their knowledge of woodcraft, wildlife, and 
forestry. Wood elves are more than capable in warfare, 
particularly archery. They are less magically inclined 
than their cousins, but have their fair share of practi- 
tioners of the Art, as well as clerics and many druids. 

Dark Elves (Drow) 

The drow are descended from the dark elves who 
retreated into the Underdark after the Crown Wars. 

They are infamous for their cruelty, evilness, and drive 
to dominate. 

For much of history, many believed that all drow were 
beings of inherent and irredeemable evil. In truth, most 
drow do align with evil, engaging in torture, slavery, 
murder, and other nefarious activities in the name of 
their demon-goddess. Almost always, dark elves who 
reject the ways of their people are exiled, or executed 
for being rebels, heretics, and insurrectionists who have 
turned against drow culture and the will of Lolth. But 
the existence of noble and self-sacrificing drow such as 
Liriel Baenre and Drizzt Do’Urden suggests that the evil 
of the drow isn’t innate and can be overcome. The ac- 
tions of these few heroic drow have tempered some peo- 
ple’s opinions toward the race, although the appearance 
of a dark elf on the surface remains a rare event and a 
cause for alarm. 

Many drow in Faerun hail from Menzoberranzan, the 
infamous City of Spiders, or one of the other drow city- 
states in the Underdark, such as Jhachalkhyn or Ched 
Nasad. Dark elves encountered on the surface are usu- 
ally found near entrances to the Underdark, because 
they are harmed by the light of day, which weakens 
them and their magic. Drow who become adventurers 
often do so after fleeing the oppressive, cruel theoc- 
racy of the city-states. Most of these individuals live as 
outcasts and wanderers, though a rare few find new 
homes with another race or culture. 



Drow have the racial traits of dark elves in the Players 
Handbook. Drow characters can come from any back- 
ground, though most have a history that links to one of 
the drow city-states of the Underdark. 

Inherent magical abilities and a preference for dark 
places make drow naturally adept as assassins, thieves, 
and spies. Traditionally, male drow are warriors and 
wizards, and female drow occupy leadership roles as 
warriors or priestesses of Lolth. Drow exiles tend to fol- 
low their own path regardless of gender. 

Elven Deities 

The gods of the Tel'Quessir, collectively known as the 
Seldarine, have embodied the ideals of the elf people 
since time immemorial. They are believed to dwell in 
the realm of Arvandor on the plane of Arborea. 

God of the Elves 

Corellon Larethian is the wise leader of the Seldarine, 
the god of elves, magic, poetry, rulership, and warcraft. 
He is thought of as the father of the race, but he is de- 
picted as female as often as he is depicted as male. 

Goddess of Wisdom 

Angharradh, triune goddess of wisdom and the fierce 
mother-protector of the elf people, is Corellon’s consort. 
Her three aspects are: Aerdrie Faenya, wild goddess of 
the winds and weather, as well as patron of the avariel; 
Hanali Celanil, the Winsome Rose, goddess of love, 


CHAPTER 3 | RACES OF THE REALMS 



Espruar, the Letters and Numerals of Elvish 


beauty, art, and enchantment; and the Moonlit Mystery, 
silver Sehanine Moonbow, goddess of all life’s myster- 
ies, including mysticism, prophecy, death, and dreams. 
In legends, these goddesses are often separate entities 
from Angharradh, and frequently depicted as Correl- 
lon’s daughters or consorts. 

Gods of Nature 

Deep Sashelas is a sea god, lord of the sea elves and of 
dolphins. Labelas Enoreth is the philosopher god, deity 
of time and history, whose gift of trance is crucial to 
elven identity and survival. Rillifane Rallathil is god of 
the woodlands and the wild places, the father of wood 
elves and protector of druids. Closely allied with him 
is Solonor Thelandira, the god of hunting, archery, and 
woodcraft. 

Gods of Shadow 

Of somewhat darker bent, Erevan Ilesere is a deity of 
mischief, a trickster-god; and Fenmarel Mestarine is the 
moody and sullen god of outcasts and solitude, who has 
little to do with the rest of the Seldarine (except for Ere- 
van, who uses Fenmarel as a scapegoat in his plots and 
pranks). And then there is Shevarash, a god thought of 
as embittered and obsessive, to whom elves turn when 
they seek vengeance. 

Faerunian Gods 

Many elves worship deities in the Faerunian pantheon, 
including Mielikki (and the unicorn goddess Lurue), Sil- 
vanus, and Sune. In recent years, some elves have found 
delight in the worship of Lathander, as well. 



Drow Deities 

The gods of the drow are fractious and treacherous as 
their worshipers. 

The Spider Queen. Lolth, the Demon Queen of Spi- 
ders, reigns supreme as goddess of the drow, ruthlessly 
eliminating all who would threaten her position. Her 
priestesses do likewise with the cults of rival gods 
among their people. 

Other Dark Powers. Selvetarm is god of warriors, 
and therefore patron of male drow, although perhaps 
not so much as Vhaeraun, the rogue god of thievery 
and of drow males who rebel against the matriarchy. 
Kiaransalee, drow goddess of the undead, is served by 
secretive cults of necromancers. Ghaunadaur, known 
as That Which Lurks, is a subversive power, the mad 
god of oozes, rebels, and outcasts, occasionally re- 
vered by drow. 

The Dark Maiden. Some drow exiles have heard the 
song of Eilistraee, urging them out onto the surface to 
behold the moon as it rises. The drow goddess of song, 
beauty, swordwork, hunting, and moonlight, she is the 
patron of drow who reject the evils of their society, offer- 
ing them light and hope. 

Halflings 

Folk think of elves as aloof and graceful, dwarves as 
fierce and hardy, and of gnomes— if they think of them 
at all— as clever and shy. Halflings, in contrast, have the 
reputation of being deft and plucky. 

Halflings, or hin as they call themselves, exhibit a 
natural adroitness that often surprises larger folk. This 
nimbleness regularly comes in handy when their cour- 
age outruns their common sense, and tales about hal- 
flings abound with lucky breaks and narrow escapes. 

Beyond these typical elements of the halfling charac- 
ter, halflings can be divided into two major subraces. 
Many aspects of the two groups’ cultures make them 
distinct, but even without such trappings they are dis- 
tinct due to a divergence in what seems to be a primal 
drive: to go or to stay. Lightfoot halflings are travelers as 
a rule, with tongues and hearts as nimble as their feet. 
W’hereas if strongheart halflings are on the move, it al- 
ways seems driven by a desire to return to home or find 
and settle in a new one. As the saying goes, “Lightfoot, 
light hearted. Strongheart, strong footing.’’ 


CHAPTER 3 | RACES OF THE REALMS 




Although there are many halfling communities, par- 
ticularly in the lands in and around Luiren, halflings fre- 
quently fit themselves into dwarven, gnomish, elven, and 
human societies. Lightfoots breeze into communities 
as they travel, make friends easily, and then move on 
as the wind or whimsy takes them. Stronghearts settle 
in, make themselves at home, and weave themselves 
so deftly into the fabric of a community that it becomes 
hard for folk to think of a time without them. 

Lightfoot Halflings 

For lightfoot halflings, neither the journey nor the des- 
tination matters more; the important thing is to keep 
moving. The life of a lightfoot is one long exploration 
with each new horizon, new town, or new face a chance 
to find something delightful. 

Lightfoot halflings typically travel in small bands, us- 
ing whatever conveyance is convenient but just as easily 
striking out on foot. Bands consist of loosely related in- 
dividuals, and when bands meet, membership frequently 
shifts. Lightfoot halflings typically excel at tasks related 
to travel— be it navigation, handling pack animals, for- 
aging, sailing, and Cartwright work— having tried their 
hand at all such things before or learned from other 
lightfoots met during their journeys. 

Lightfoot halflings are highly social, often as curious 
about other people as they are about what might lie 
around the next bend. They characteristically possess 
an easygoing and open attitude, curious about others 
and willing to share of themselves, which enables them 
to make friends easily. Their facile friendships and ease 
with partings can make lightfoot halflings seem disin- 
genuous to others. Lightfoot halflings get stereotyped as 
flighty, easily distracted, fickle, and unreliable. But their 
friendships and courtships, if brief, tend to be genuine. 
The staid and stable life that most other people desire 
just isn’t part of their character. 

Lightfoot halflings have all the racial traits of lightfoot 
halflings in the Player's Handbook. They share the skin, 
hair, and eye tones of humans, but most lightfoot hal- 
flings have hazel or brown eyes and brown hair. Light- 
foot halflings don’t grow facial hair except that males 
and females typically grow short sideburns. 

Strongheart Halflings 

Creatures of the earth who love a warm hearth and 
pleasant company, strongheart halflings are folks of few 
enemies and many friends. Stronghearts are sometimes 
referred to fondly by members of other races as “the 
good folk,” for little upsets stronghearts or corrupts 
their spirit. To many of them, the greatest fear is to live 
in a world of poor company and mean intent, where one 
lacks freedom and the comfort of friendship. 

When strongheart halflings settle into a place, they 
intend to stay. It’s not unusual for a dynasty of strong- 
hearts to live in the same place for a few centuries. 
Strongheart halflings don’t develop these homes in 
seclusion. On the contrary, they do their best to fit into 
the local community and become an essential part of 
it. Their viewpoint stresses cooperation above all other 


traits, and the ability to work well with others is the 
most valued behavior in their lands. 

Pushed from their nests, strongheart haflings typi- 
cally try to have as many comforts of home with them as 
possible. Non-stronghearts with a more practical bent 
can find strongheart travel habits maddening, but their 
lightfoot cousins typically enjoy the novelty of it— so long 
as the lightfoots don’t have to carry any of the baggage. 

While often stereotyped as fat and lazy due to their 
homebound mindset and obsession with fine food, 
strongheart halfings are typically quite industrious. 
Nimble hands, their patient mindset, and their emphasis 
on quality makes them excellent weavers, potters, wood 
carvers, basket makers, painters, and farmers. 

Strongheart halflings have all the racial traits of 
stouts in the Players Handbook. Strongheart halflings 
are shorter on average than their lightfoot kin, and tend 
to have rounder faces. They have the skin tones and hair 
colors of humans, with most having brown hair. Unlike 
their lightfoot cousins, strongheart halflings often have 
blond or black hair and blue or green eyes. Males don’t 
grow beards or mustaches, but both males and females 
can grow sideburns down to mid-cheek, and both gen- 
ders plait them into long braids. 

Halfling Deities 

The hin have a small but intimate pantheon of deities, 
which are honored primarily at household altars, road- 
side shrines, and wooded groves. 

The Blessed Sisters 

The hin mother-goddess and the head of the pantheon 
is Yondalla, the Blessed One, goddess of bounty and 
fertility, protector of hearth, home, and family. Sheela 
Peryroyl is the Green Sister of Yondalla. She is a nature 
goddess, the lady of fields, streams, and the wilds found 
in shire and glen, and the weather in such places. She is 
also a goddess of love, song, and dance.

Ghostwise Halflincs 

Ghostwise halflings trace their ancestry back to a war 
among halfling tribes that sent their ancestors into flight 
from Luiren. Ghostwise halflings are the rarest of the bin, 
found only in the Chondalwood and a few other isolated 
forests, clustered in tight-knit clans. 

Many ghostwise clans select a natural landmark as the 
center of their territory, and members carry a piece of that 
landmark with them at all times. Clan warriors known as 
nightgliders bond with and ride giant owls as mounts. 

Because these folk are clannish and mistrustful of out- 
siders, ghostwise halfling adventurers are rare. Ask your 
DM if you can play a member of this subrace, which has 
the halfling traits in the Player’s Handbook, plus the sub- 
race traits below. 

Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score in- 
creases by 1. 

Silent Speech. You can speak telepathically to any crea- 
ture within 30 feet of you. The creature understands you 
only if the two of you share a language. You can speak tele- 
pathically in this way to one creature at a time. 


Keepers of the Home 

Cyrrollalee is goddess of the hearth and hospitality, as 
well as of trust and handicrafts. Arvoreen is a defend- 
er-god, a watchful protector who sacrifices personal 
comfort for the safety of others. 

The Shadowed Gods 

Brandobaris is the trickster-god of thievery and stealth, 
patron of many halfling adventurers. Urogalan is the 
silent, melancholy god of the earth and death. Accompa- 
nied everywhere by a great dark hound, he is saddened 
by his duties, and vigilant in ensuring that the dead are 
respected and protected. 

Lady Luck 

Many halflings have taken to regular worship of Tymora, 
seeing her as a helping hand in their fortunes and a pa- 
tron of the luckiness associated with the hin. 

Humans 

Humans dwell in every corner of Toril and encompass a 
full range of cultures and ethnicities. Along the Sword 
Coast and across the North, humans are the most perva- 
sive of the races and in many places the most dominant. 
Their cultural and societal makeup runs the gamut, 
from the cosmopolitan folk who reside in great cities 


such as Baldurs Gate and Waterdeep to the barbarians 
who rage throughout the Savage Frontier. 

Humans are famous for their adaptability. No other 
race lives in so many diverse lands or environments, 
from lush jungles to burning deserts, from the eternal 
cold of the Great Glacier to the fertile shores along 
rivers and seas. Humans find ways to survive and 
to thrive almost anywhere. In locations where elves 
and dwarves have withdrawn, humans often move 
in and build anew alongside or on top of an earlier 
community. 

It follows, then, that the most common feature of hu- 
mans is their lack of commonality. This diversity has 
enabled human civilizations to grow faster than those of 
other races, making humans one of the dominant races 
in much of the world today. It has also led to conflicts be- 
tween communities of humans because of their cultural 
and political differences. If not for their penchant for 
infighting, humans would be even more populous and 
predominant than they already are. 

Human Ethnicities in Faerun 

Nine human ethnicities in Faerun are detailed in the 
Players Handbook. Several other noteworthy groups 
of humans are discussed here. Some are significant 
minorities in regions or nations that border the North, 
while others are prevalent in parts of the world far from 
the Sword Coast. 

Arkaiun 

Short in stature with tan skin and dark hair, the Arkai- 
uns dwell primarily in Dambrath as well as Halruaa and 
the Shar. Many Arkaiuns lived under the yoke of drow 
slavery centuries ago after a failed military campaign 
against the dark elves, which led to the eventual destruc- 
tion of the Arkaiun kingdom in Dambrath. 

Arkaiun Names: (Male) Houn, Rhivaun, Umbril, 
Xaemar, Zeltaebar; (female) Glouris, Maeve, 

Sevaera, Xaemarra, Zraela; (surnames) Lharaendo, 
Mristar, Wyndael 

Bedine 

Dark-skinned and dark-haired, the Bedine were war- 
riors and nomads in southern Anauroch. Once divided 
into over a hundred tribes, the clannish Bedine mostly 
kept to their desert lands and interacted little with 
outsiders, except for trading. Over the generations, more

Lalajar, Qahtan, Yethtai, Zazalaar 

Ffolk 

The Ffolk of the Moonshae Isles are descended from 
Tethyrian settlers who came to the isles a thousand 
years ago. The Ffolk have a deep respect for nature, and 
are primarily farmers, worshiping the goddess they call 
the Earthmother and keeping to old druidic ways. Ffolk 
shipwrights are well regarded, having proven their abil- 
ity to build sturdy ships that are capable of weathering 
the tumultuous seas around their home. 

Ffolk Names: (Male) Artur, Bern, Colin, Manfred, 
Tristan; (female) Alicia, Gennifer, Meridith, Elaine, 
Olivia; (surnames) Archer, Gareth, Leed, Kendrick, 
Morgan, Waters 

Gur 

Related to the Rashemi, Gurs are stout, dusky-skinned, 
and dark-haired. They consider themselves “children 
of Selune,” and most of them revere the moon goddess. 
Gur communities live a nomadic existence wandering 
the Western Heartlands, leading others to refer to them 
as “the people of the highway.” 

Gur Names: (Male) Boriv, Gardar, Madevik, Vlad; 
(female) Varra, Ulmarra, Imza, Navarra, Yuldra; 
(surnames) Chergoba, Drazlad, Tazyara, Vargoba, 
Stayankina 

Halruaan 

The people of the mysterious and magical kingdom of 
Halruaa, the Halruaans are touched by magic, and many 
of them are talented in the Art. They and their land 
vanished during the Spellplague, but just as mysterious- 
ly returned after the second Sundering. Most Halruaans 
have blond or dark hair and olive complexions. Black, 
brown, and green eyes are the most common. 

Halruaan Names: (Male) Aldym, Chand, Meleghost, 
Presmer, Sandrue, Uregaunt; (female) Aithe, Chalan, 
Oloma, Phaele, Sarade; (surnames) Avhoste, Darante, 
Maurmeril, Stamaraster 

Imaskari 

An uprising of Mulan slaves brought about the ruin 
of Imaskar and its ruling wizards thousands of years 
ago, but some Imaskari survived and fled into the 
Underdark. There they changed, developing the pale, 
smooth skin and whitish hair now common among 
them. The Imaskari who dominated the region of Mul- 
horand have been forced into exile by a second uprising 
of those they dominated. 

Imaskari Names: (Male) Charva, Duma, Hukir, Jama, 
Pradir, Sikhil; (female) Apret, Bask, Fanul, Mokat, 
Nismet, Ril; (surnames) Datharathi, Melpurvatta, 
Nalambar, Tiliputakas 



Nar 

More than a thousand years ago, the dark priests of 
Narfell amassed great power by treating with demons, 
but their actions eventually brought about a war that 
destroyed their civilization. The Nars abandoned 
their ruined and accursed cities and became nomads 
and traders. Nars have tanned skin, brown or black 
eyes, and black hair, often worn long and tied in a tail 
or topknot. 

Nar Names: (Male) Avan, Ostaram, Petro, Stor, Taman, 
Thalaman, Urth; (female) Anva, Dasha, Dima, Olga, 
Westra, Zlatara; (surnames) Dashkev, Hargroth, 
Laboda, Lackman, Stonar, Stormwind, Sulyma 

Shaaran 

Dark-haired and tan-skinned nomads from southern 
Faerun, the Shaarans are skilled hunters, archers, 
and riders who revere various nature deities. They are 
organized into clans under the direction of elders and 
chieftains. 

Shaaran Names: (Male) Awar, Cohis, Damota, Gewar, 
Hapah, Laskaw, Senesaw, Tokhis; (female) Anet, Bes, 
Idim, Lenet, Moqem, Neghet, Sihvet; (surnames) Cor 
Marak, Laumee Harr, Moq Qo Harr, Woraw Tarak 

Tuigan 

A nomadic horde from the vast plains between Faerun 
and Kara-Tur, the Tuigans once nearly conquered 
Faerun under the great leader Yamun Khahan before 


CHAPTER 3 | RACES OF THE REALMS 



Option: Human Languages 

Many human ethnicities and nations in Faerun have their 
own language, in addition to Common. Most human 
languages are written in Thorass, the alphabet of Old 
Common, derived from the Chondathan language that 
traders used as their common tongue. A few human lan- 
guages use other alphabets, including Draconic, Dethek, 
and Espruar. The languages of the ethnicities described in 
the Player's Handbook and this book are as follows: 

Arkaiun: Dambrathan (written in Espruar) 

Bedine: Midani 
Calishite: Alzhedo 
Chondathan: Chondathan 
Damaran: Damaran (written in Dethek) 

Ffolk: Waelan 

Gur: Curan (a patois of Roushoum and Rashemi) 
Halruaan: Halruaan (written in Draconic) 
llluskan: llluskan 
Imaskari: Roushoum 

Mulan: Chessentan, Mulhorandi, Untheric, orThayan 
Nar: Damaran 
Rashemi: Rashemi 

Shaaran: Shaaran (written in Dethek) 

Shou: Shou 
Tethyrian: Chondathan 
Tuigan: Tuigan 
Turami: Turmic 
Ulutiun: Uluik 

If your Dungeon Master allows this option, then any hu- 
man from an ethnic group that has its own language is 
assumed to know that language as well as Common. This 
ethnic language is treated as a free additional language for 
such individuals. 


being defeated by a coalition of armies. Since those 
days, Tuigans are sometimes seen on the Sword Coast 
and in other nearby regions, but not in great numbers. 

The Tuigans resemble the Shou, with a bronze or 
golden cast to their skin and dark hair, but they tend to 
have darker skin and broader features. Each has only a 
single name (sometimes handed down from one’s par- 
ent); Tuigans don’t use surnames. No strangers to travel, 
Tuigan traders and adventurers are often familiar with 
many languages and cultures. 

Tuigan Names: (Male) Atlan, Bayar, Chingis, Chinua, 
Mongke, Temur; (female) Bolormaa, Bortai, 

Erdene, Naran 

Ulutiun 

The Ulutiuns are short, dark-haired, golden-skinned 
people who originated in northern Kara-Tur and migrat- 
ed westward to Icewind Dale and other cold lands near 
the Endless Ice Sea. Hunters and gatherers, Ulutiuns 
live in small tribes that have managed to survive in one 
of the harshest environments in the world. Each has 
only a single name (sometimes handed down from one’s 
parent); Ulutiuns don't use surnames. 

Ulutiun Names: (Male) Amak, Chu, Imnek, Kanut, Siku; 
(female) Akna, Chena, Kaya, Sedna, Ublereak 


Humans’ Deities 

The breadth and variety of the human race in Faerun 
is never more evident than in the diverse collection of 
deities that humans worship. The Faerunian pantheon 
(detailed in chapter 1) includes gods of every stripe, 
and a number of deities whose spheres of influence 
overlap and compete, which seems to be just how hu- 
mans like it. 

Along the Sword Coast, most human communities 
have temples and shrines tended by priests who are 
devoted to various Faerunian gods. In some of these 
places, the faithful of deities revered by rulers and other 
powerful individuals play a greater role in local politics 
than those not so favored. In the extreme, worship that 
is deemed heretical or dangerous is outlawed— for exam- 
ple, in a region where followers of Shar hold authority 
and power, the worship of her good twin and nemesis 
Selune might be against the law. 

Dragonborn 

Draconic humanoids from another world, the dragon- 
born of Faerun are proud, honorable, and relatively rare. 
Slaves to dragons on their world of origin, they are now 
a free people looking for a place and purpose in their 
new world. 

Uncertai n Origins 

As with all stories of the ancient past, tales of the origins 
of the dragonborn are hazy and sometimes contradic- 
tory. Each reveals something about the dragonborn in 
its telling, however. 

One story relates that the dragonborn were shaped by 
the ancient dragon-god Io at the same time that Io cre- 
ated the dragons. In the beginning of days, Io fused bril- 
liant astral spirits with the unchecked fury of the ele- 
ments. The greater spirits became dragons— creatures 
so powerful, proud, and willful that they were lords of 
the newborn world. The lesser spirits became the drag- 
onborn. Although smaller in stature, they were no less 
draconic in nature. This tale stresses the close kinship 
between dragons and dragonborn, while reinforcing 
the natural order of things— dragons rule and dragon- 
born serve, at least according to the dragonborn’s for- 
mer masters. 

Another legend asserts that Io created the dragons 
at the birth of the world, but dragonborn did not yet 
exist. Then, during the Dawn War, Io was killed by the 
primordial known as Erek-Hus, the King of Terror. With 
a rough-hewn axe of adamantine, the behemoth split Io 
from head to tail, cleaving the dragon-god into two equal 
halves, which rose up as new gods— Bahamut and Tia- 
mat. Droplets of Io’s blood, spattered across the world, 
became the first dragonborn. For some who believe it, 
this origin story supports the view that dragonborn are 
clearly inferior to the dragons that were made by Io’s lov- 
ing hand, while others emphasize that the dragonborn 
arose from Io’s own blood— just as two draconic deities 
arose from the god’s severed body. So are the dragon- 
born not, therefore, like the gods themselves? 

A third origin story posits that dragonborn were the 
firstborn of the world, created by Io before the existence 


! 


CHAPTER 3 | RACES OF THE REALMS 


of other humanoid races, which were pale imitations of 
dragonborn perfection. Io shaped the dragonborn and 
fired them with his breath, then spilled his own blood 
to give them life. The first dragonborn served Io as 
companions and allies, filling his astral court and sing- 
ing his praises. The dragons he made only later, at the 
start of the Dawn War, to serve as engines of destruc- 
tion. This view of dragonborn history is shared by those 
who believe that dragonborn are superior to other races 
and thus should be the masters of dragons and not the 
other way around. 

Despite their differing conclusions, a common theme 
binds all these legends together: the dragonborn owe 
their existence to Io, the great dragon-god who created 
all of dragonkind. The dragonborn, all legends agree, 
are not the creations of Bahamut or Tiamat— and so 
they have no predetermined side in the conflict between 
those gods. Every individual dragonborn, regardless of 
one’s particular draconic ancestry, makes a personal 
choice in matters of ethics and morality. 

The Fight for Freedom 

Dragonborn hail from Abeir, the primordial twin of To- 
ril. On that world most of the dragonborn are slaves to 
their dragon masters, though many won their freedom 
and formed nations of free dragonborn. During the 
Spellplague, the two worlds intersected and one of those 
free dragonborn nations, Tymanchebar, was transported 
to Faerun. It displaced the nation of Unther, and out of 
the ashes of these two kingdoms, the surviving drag- 
onborn formed Tymanther, a new dragonborn nation 
in Faerun. 

For a time, the dragonborn of Tymanther sought to 
integrate with their new world while maintaining their 
own traditions and culture. These efforts gave the na- 
tion and its people a reputation for being honorable and 
worthy of respect. Only a few generations later, however, 
the events of the Sundering returned Unther to Faerun, 
and the formerly displaced land sought to reclaim all it 
had lost to Tymanther. Reeling from this disaster, the re- 
maining dragonborn in Faerun now find they must work 
even harder and with fewer resources to find their place 
among the people the world. 

Honor and Family 

Every aspect of dragonborn life is dictated by the race’s 
code of honor and strict adherence to tradition. Drag- 
onborn society is highly ordered, with each member 
expected to do one’s utmost for family and clan. This loy- 
alty and sense of duty sustained the dragonborn during 
their long history of enslavement and also enabled them 
to form communities and nations of free dragonborn. 

In dragonborn culture, the family is made up of one’s 
direct relations, while a clan is a collection of families 
brought together by alliance, intermarriage, or shared 
history. Although they are rarely forced to choose one 
over the other, the clan’s welfare is more important 
to most dragonborn than the family’s. The promise of 
honor within the clan drives them to acts of heroism, 
daring, or excellence, all meant to bring glory to the clan 
first and the individual second. 



The aftermath of the Sundering has tested these prin- 
ciples, leaving some clans fractured and decentralized. 
Some dragonborn in Faerun seek to recapture the sort 
of connection they had with a now-lost clan or family by 
forging new relationships among their non-dragonborn 
allies and companions. 

Dragonborn in Faerun have the racial traits of dragon- 
born in the Players Handbook. 


Philosophy and Religion 

Their code of honorable behavior and unswerving 
loyalty serves the dragonborn as a kind of faith, and, 
according to the traditionalists among them, that out- 
look is all the religion they need. Because they were 
forced to worship their draconic masters in times past, 
dragonborn are generally skeptical about religion, see- 
ing it as a form of servitude. The skeptics believe that 
no matter how their original god, Io, brought them into 
being, that ancient deity is either long dead or uncaring 
about their fate, and the dragon gods that supplanted Io 
seem primarily interested in amassing soldiers for their 
ages-old conflict. 

Still, some dragonborn do hear the call of the gods 
of Faerun and choose to serve them, and are as loyal in 
this faith as they are to any other cause. Bahamut and 
Tiamat have dragonborn worshipers, and both Torm 
and Tyr appeal to the dragonborn sense of honor and 


CHAPTER 3 | RACES OF THE REALMS 





Indeed, members of other races sometimes thought- 
lessly treat gnomes as second-class citizens, perhaps 
thinking highly of their gnome friends but rarely giving 
credit to gnomes as a people. Gnomes are regularly un- 
derestimated, and they use that lack of esteem as both a 
defense and an offense, when need be. 

Like dwarves, gnomes have long battled for territory 
with kobolds, goblinoids, and ores, but gnomes and ko- 
bolds share a special hatred for each other. Both races 
believe in a legend that, long ago, the deity Garl Glit- 
tergold tricked the kobold god Kurtulmak, collapsing 
the earth and trapping him in an endless underground 
maze and earning his everlasting enmity. 

Forest Gnomes 

The reclusive forest gnomes live simply in hillside dwell- 
ings deep in the woods. A neighbor could live only a few 
miles from a forest gnome settlement for a lifetime and 
never know it. In these communities, anonymity and 
stealth help to ensure protection, peace, and survival. 

If they are discovered and treated well, forest gnomes 
make fine neighbors, but they usually avoid contact even 
with civilizations that seem friendly. 

Forest gnomes use their affinity with small animals 
and their knack for illusions to help them remain hid- 
den. When necessary, a forest gnome community de- 
fends itself with all the resources at its disposal. Many 
settlements, however, simply vanish if they are discov- 
ered, retreating to some uncharted corner of the forest 
to begin anew. 

The rare forest gnomes who leave their people to 
become adventurers often draw upon their closeness to 
nature and their magical gifts to serve as guides, scouts, 
or mystics. Living close to nature also makes forest 
gnomes likely to take up roles as druids, who serve vari- 
ous forest spirits and deities. 

Forest gnomes in Faerun have the racial traits of for- 
est gnomes in the Players Handbook. 

Rock Gnomes 

When most folk on the Sword Coast and in the North 
talk about gnomes, they mean rock gnomes. Unlike 
their shy forest cousins, the inquisitive and irrepressible 
rock gnomes interact regularly with individuals of other 
races, especially if those individuals have something to 
teach them. Rock gnomes prefer to live on the edges of 
other settlements in their own enclaves, though the oc- 
casional adventuresome rock gnome takes up residence 
in a human or dwarven city. 

Ladies of the Golden Hills 

A curious bit of gnomish lore is that the pantheon counts 
not a single female within its ranks. Legend has it that the 
mysterious Ladies of the Golden Hills went away together 
on some task in the most ancient days, and have not yet 
returned. The stories differ as to the Ladies’ task, from 
seeking to gather examples of all of the beauty and riches 
of Toril, to a secret plan to thwart the evils of the world us- 
ing their anonymity as a shield, causing the world to forget 
even their names and identities for a time. Gnomes who 
wander far from home are said to have “gone looking for 
the Ladies.” 


order. Similarly, Tempus and the Red Knight appeal to 
the warrior spirit in some dragonborn, and Kelemvor 
speaks to some of the inevitability of death and the need 
to live well in one’s allotted time. Religious belief is an 
intensely personal thing the dragonborn who espouse it, 
some of whom are as devoted to their faith as they are to 
their family and clan. 

Gnomes 

Small of stature and dwelling in the corners of Faerun 
away from prying eyes, gnomes are one of the least pop- 
ulous and influential races in the world, called the “For- 
gotten Folk” by some. This appellation doesn't bother 
the gnomes; they generally prefer their anonymity and 
the protection it affords them. 

According to legend, the first gnomes in Faerun 
sprang from mystic gems buried deep in the earth— an 
event that accounts for both the gnomes’ love of gems 
and the cozy embrace of their underground warrens. It 
is said that mystic diamonds became the rock gnomes, 
emeralds birthed the forest gnomes, and rubies turned 
into the deep gnomes. Since the time of their creation, 
gnomes have settled in hidden places away from other 
races, concerned that their way of life couldn’t survive 
wider exposure. 

Gnomes gladly socialize and work with humans, 
elves, and dwarves, but they always keep in mind that, 
as a small and relatively insignificant race, their inter- 
ests can become secondary even among their allies. 


CHAPTER 3 | RACES OF THE REALMS 





Rock gnome communities are most common in the 
Western Heartlands and along the coast of the Shining 
Seal but gnome wanderers travel between communities 
across Faerun in order to trade with or learn from out- 
siders, including members of other races. 

Rock gnomes who leave their communities often find 
work by using their racial aptitudes to their advantage. 
Their heritage and their interest in precious stones 
leads many rock gnomes to become skilled gemcutters 
and jewelers. Rock gnomes also use their affinity with 
machines to work as tinkers, alchemists, and engi- 
neers. In human communities, gnome tutors and sages 
are popular, since their comparatively long life spans 
enable them to acquire and pass on knowledge for 
generations. 

Rock gnomes in Faerun have the racial traits of rock 
gnomes in the Players Handbook. 

Deep Gnomes (Svirfneblin) 

Also known as svirfneblin, the deep gnomes of the Un- 
derdark are a stark contrast to their surface kin, dour 
and serious compared to the cheerful and generally 
optimistic rock gnomes and forest gnomes. They share 
their cousins’ obsession with privacy, and their homes 
below the surface of Faerun are well guarded and 
deeply hidden. 

Owing to the hostility of their Underdark neighbors, 
particularly the drow, the settlements and kingdoms of 
svirfneblin are in constant danger of being relocated, 
conquered, or destroyed. Such was the fate of Bling- 
denstone, one of the grandest deep gnome strongholds, 
which existed for more than two thousand years until it 
was overrun a little more than a century ago by the dark 
elves of Menzoberranzan. The deep gnomes recently 
reclaimed their old home, and now struggle to rid it of 
malign influences that have crept into the tunnels and 
warrens in their absence. 

Deep gnomes are lean with dark, earthen skin tones 
of gray. Males are bald and beardless, while females 
have hair on their heads. Both sexes have little or no 
body hair and a stone-like look to their skin. 

Deep gnome adventurers are just as curious and 
daring as those of other races. Some find their purpose 
living among other subterranean races, and a few make 
their way to the surface. Those who study the arcane 
arts of illusion in particular often range far from home, 
seeking knowledge unavailable in their own lands. 

Svirfneblin Subrace Traits 

The svirfneblin subrace has the gnome traits in the 
Players Handbook , plus the subrace traits below. Unlike 
other gnomes, svirfneblin tend to be neutral, they weigh 
80 to 120 pounds, and they reach maturity at 25 and live 
200 to 250 years. 

Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score in- 
creases by 1. 

Superior Darkvision. Your darkvision has a radius 
of 120 feet. 

Stone Camouflage. You have advantage on Dexterity 
(Stealth) checks to hide in rocky terrain. 

Extra Language. You can speak, read, and write 
Undercommon. 


Deep Gnome Feat 

If your DM allows the use of feats, your deep gnome char- 
acter has the option of taking the following feat. 

Svirfneblin Magic 

Prerequisite: Gnome (deep gnome) 

You have inherited the innate spellcasting ability of your 
ancestors. This ability allows you to cast nondetection on 
yourself at will, without needing a material component. 
You can also cast each of the following spells once with 
this ability: blindness/deafness, blur, and disguise self. You 
regain the ability to cast these spells when you finish 
a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for 
these spells. 


Gnomish Deities 

Gnomes honor a small pantheon of seven primary dei- 
ties, known as the Lords of the Golden Hills, plus two 
other entities. 

Wise Protectors 

The Watchful Protector, Garl Glittergold, is the king of 
gnomish gods, a deity of humor, gemcutting, protection, 
and trickery. His pranks serve to protect gnomes and to 
teach his victims humility and wisdom. Garl’s second, 
Gaerdal Ironhand, is the gnomes’ war god, who es- 
pouses vigilance and defense. 

Nature Gods 

Baervan Wildwanderer is the gnomish god of forests 
and woodlands, accompanied by his companion Chik- 
tikka Fastpaws, a great raccoon said to be the wiser of 
the two. Segojan Earthcaller is god of the wilds beneath 
the earth, rather than upon it, as well as god of burrows 
and the plants and animals found therein. 

Shadow and Stone 

Baravar Cloakshadow is the god of illusion and decep- 
tion, given the respectful title of Sly One. Callarduran 
Smoothhands is the god of stone and the Underdark, 
patron of the svirfneblin. 

Craft and Invention 

Flandal Steelskin, the god of mining and smithcraft, is 
known as the Steelsmith. He is also the gnomes’ god 
of physical improvement and good health. The fearless 
Nebelun the Meddler is the god of invention and luck, re- 
vered by many gnomes even though he isn’t considered 
one of the Lords of the Golden Hills. “Nebelun’s head!” 
is a common gnomish exclamation of discovery. 

The Crawler Below 

The last member of the gnomish pantheon is Urdlen, 
which appears not as a gnome, but an elephantine, 
blind, pale mole. Urdlen is the great-clawed god of 
bloodlust and evil, of greed and uncontrolled impulses. 
Young gnomes are warned to “never let Urdlen bur- 
row into your heart,” as a caution against giving in to 
wicked impulses. 


CHAPTER 3 | RACES OF THE REALMS 



Half-Elves 

An elf who looks upon a half-elf sees a human, and a hu- 
man who beholds the same person sees an elf. Though 
this characterization is simplistic, it gets to the heart of 
what it means to be a half-elf in Faerun. 

To elves who have an extreme viewpoint on the mat- 
ter, half-elves are emblematic of the decline of elven civi- 
lization, a dilution of the races heritage and culture that 
will lead to its eventual dissolution. To the humans at 
the other end of the spectrum, half-elves have an unfair 
advantage over their fully human peers, and are seen 
as privileged or favored regardless of the actual circum- 
stances of their birth. 

For most folk in Faerun, the issue isn’t so cut and 
dried. Half-elves are generally tolerated wherever they 
go, or wherever they take up residence— with the proviso 
that a society that doesn’t look kindly on elves or hu- 
mans is likely to feel the same way about someone who 
has the blood of both races. Conversely, a society that 
holds humans or elves in high esteem doesn’t usually 
bestow the same status on half-elves (though such indi- 
viduals are generally not ostracized). 

Young Race, Old Roots 

In the distant past, half-elves were scarce because 
humans and elves came into contact only infrequently. 
The ancient elven kingdoms of Cormanthyr and Myth 
Drannor had significant populations of half-elves. It is 


CHAPTER 3 | RACES OF THE REALMS

\\ 


only in the past thousand years or so, as the races have 
intermingled more and more, that the number of half- 
elves has increased so that they are now found through- 
out Faerun. 

Not surprisingly, half-elves enjoy the company of 
others of their kind, such that where half-elves congre- 
gate, they are likely to be joined by others. Most of the 
half-elves in the North and along the Sword Coast are 
of moon elf heritage mixed with Illuskan or Tethyrian 
blood. In other parts of Faerun, half-elves have signif- 
icant communities in the Yuirwood and throughout 
Aglarond. Aquatic half-elves are found along the coasts, 
including near Aglarond, the Dragon Coast, Impiltur, 
Sembia, and the Vilhon Reach. Drow half-elves are 
most numerous in the nation of Dambrath, which was 
conquered by the dark elves years ago, and in the Un- 
derdark, where House Ousstyl of Menzoberranzan is 
particularly infamous for having mated with humans. 

Mixed Heritage 

Half-elves are a diverse lot, given the number of combi- 
nations of elf subraces and human ethnicities in their 
ranks. Most of them consider their dual nature a bless- 
ing more than a disadvantage, because it gives them a 
set of capabilities and a perspective on the world that 
full-blooded humans and elves can’t hope to match. 

At the same time, the mixed heritage of half-elves 
dictates that they make an effort to fit in with humans 
or elves when possible. For instance, half-elves born 
and raised in human settlements tend to have human 
names, while half-elves in elven communities generally 
have elven names. In some places half-elf children are 
named according to the “other” parent, or with a mix of 
human and elven names, as a way of setting half-elves 
apart from the rest of their community. 

Half-elves speak both Common and Elvish. In addi- 
tion, half-elves from the Yuirwood commonly speak 
Aglarondan. 

Half-elves in Faerun have the racial traits of half-elves 
in the Players Handbook , although some variations are 
possible; see the “Half-Elf Variants” sidebar. 

The Gods of Two Peoples 

There are no half-elven gods, so half-elves follow el- 
ven or human deities of their choosing— although just 
as many religious half-elves believe that their gods 
choose them. Half-elves often revere the gods of the 
culture in which they were raised, although some rebel 

Half-Elf Variants 

Some half-elves in Faerun have a racial trait in place of 

the Skill Versatility trait. If your DM allows it, your half-elf 

character can forgo Skill Versatility and instead take the elf 

trait Keen Senses or a trait based on your elf parentage: 

• A half-elf of wood elf descent can choose the wood elf’s 
Elf Weapon Training, Fleet of Foot, or Mask of the Wild. 

• A half-elf of moon elf or sun elf descent can choose the 
high elf’s ElfWeapon Training or Cantrip. 

• A half-elf of drow descent can choose the drow’s 
Drow Magic. 

• A half-elf of aquatic heritage can choose a swimming 
speed of 30 feet. 




eSru-. 


against their upbringing, seeking out the gods of the 
other aspect of their heritage, or feeling a calling or 
need to do so. 

As with any people, half-elves often choose a favored 
deity based on their calling or profession: Corellon Lare- 
thian, Azuth, or Mystra for wizards, Solonor Thelandira 
or Mielikki for rangers, Milil or Corellon for poets and 
bards, and so forth. 

Many half-elves worship Sune or Hanali Celanil in ap- 
preciation for the love their parents felt for one another, 
and the two goddesses are seen as boon companions. 
Some half-elves are drawn to outsiders such as Auril, 
Eldath, Erevan Ilesere, and Ilmater, or to nature gods 
like Mielikki, Rillifane Rallathil, and Silvanus. Half- 
elves from Aglarond often choose Chauntea, Selune, or 
one of the Seldarine as their patron. 


Half-Orcs 


Half-ores have existed in the world since before the 
dawn of recorded history, when ores and humans first 
came into contact. Yet, in all that time, they have found 
few places for themselves in Faerunian civilization— or, 
perhaps more accurately, civilization has never made 
room for them. 

Most of the common folk have an aversion to half-ores 
based largely on their appearance: anyone who looks 
that much like an ore, they reason, must be like an ore 
and should be kept at a distance. Because half-ores are 
typically stronger and hardier than their human peers, 
they can find employment in towns and cities, but their 
appearance marks them as outsiders . In response to be- 
ing ostracized, half-ores either embrace their otherness 
and take pride in their physical superiority, pull back 
and try not to draw too much attention to themselves, 
or give up trying to fit in anywhere and adopt a nomadic 
lifestyle. 

Half-ores in Faerun have the racial traits of half-ores 
in the Player's Handbook. They speak both Common 
and Ore. The rare written examples of the Ore language 
use the Dethek alphabet. 

Blood Will Tell 

Half-ores ultimately owe their plight to the deity 
Gruumsh, the creator of the ores. Legend has it that 
when Gruumsh discovered all the territories of the 
world had been claimed by other races, he swore the 
ores would avenge themselves by taking what they 
wanted by force. The great ore hordes continue to do 
just that today, appearing periodically from out of the 
wilderness to raid and scavenge. 

As a result, the word “ore” has no pleasant connota- 
tion in the minds of other Faerunians. At the same time, 
the word “half” is a mark of derision among ores. Some 
half-ores raised among ores react to this stigma by be- 
ing more brutal than others of their tribe, which can put 
them in roles of leadership, but outsider half-ores aren’t 
welcomed into ore society because they aren’t of pure 
ore blood. And they aren't accepted into other societies 
because of their ore heritage. 

Half-ores are seen as off-putting and intimidating by 
other people, which is both a blessing and a curse, be- 



cause while they are often left alone by those who fear 
them, they also become targets of discrimination, or out- 
right attacks, from those who feel threatened by them. 
This prejudice against the race makes half-ores slow to 
trust even those who show them courtesy— because they 
all have stories of when they were tricked by such be- 
havior. Their ore blood— the Mark of Gruumsh— makes 
them quick to anger and inclined to lash out at those 
who treat them unfairly. 

Having grown up among ores or under the shadow 
of their heritage, half-ores rarely have experience with 
pleasant society, and they often come off as coarse, 
blunt, or rude in dealings with other people. With the 
directness of an ore, they speak their minds with no ap- 
parent concern for how their opinions are received. No 
matter where they live, half-ores usually find themselves 
defined by others in terms of their usefulness as heavy 
laborers and soldiers. It is the rare and fortunate few 
who are judged by their character and their deeds rather 
than their ancestry. 

Half-Orc Homelands 

In lands far from the Sword Coast, such as Thesk and 
Chessenta, there are large communities of half-ores, 
where generations of them have lived as a people in 
their own right. Yet there are few such places in the 
North. A small community was growing near the 


CHAPTER 3 | RACES OF THE REALMS 





wr- 




T 





Kingdom of Many Arrows, but the recent war with the 
ores of that realm caused this burgeoning population 
to disperse. 

Today no civilized place in the North has a sig- 
nificant population of half-ores, although at least 
a few of them reside in or on the outskirts of any 
stable community. Ironically, it is among the largest 
and most civilized of these places that half-ores are 
likely to find acceptance— in the great cities where 
people are often more cosmopolitan in their outlook. 

In Waterdeep, for instance, half-ores make up a tiny 
percentage of the population, yet even at that they still 
number in the hundreds. Half-ores who call Waterdeep 
home appreciate the acceptance, or at least tolerance, 
they receive in the city, whether they were born there, 
arrived overland from elsewhere on the continent, or 
entered the city by way of ships bringing trade. 

Half-Orc Deities 

As befits their dual nature, many half-ores revere deities 
from both the human and the ore pantheons. Alone or 
among themselves, half-ores offer prayers to ore deities, 
particularly Ilneval, who is thought of as a patron of half- 
ores and other ore crossbreeds. 

Faerunian Gods 

Half-ores trying to fit in with human society often adopt 
a human deity out of expediency (though rarely just for 
the sake of appearances). They favor Faerunian deities 
of war and trickery, such as Bane, Mask, and Tempus. 

First Family 

The ore pantheon, known as the Tribe of He Who 
Watches, is a group of brutal and cruel gods, dominated 
by their father and chieftain, Gruumsh One-Eye. This 
god of conquest, strength, and survival is the hated ri- 
val of the elven deity Corellon Larethian. It is said that 
Gruumsh owes the loss of his eye to Corellon’s aim 
with an arrow. 

The mother-deity of the ores is Luthic, mate of 
Gruumsh, and the goddess of fecundity, caverns, 
and witchery. 

Bahgtru, the son of Gruumsh, is the god of pure, brute 
strength, renowned for his power but disdained by some 
for his oafishness. 

Horde Leader 

The patron deity of half-ores is the war god Ilneval. He 
has the title of War Master in the pantheon, revered by 
those who believe in the wisdom of attacking with over- 
whelming numbers. 

Black and White 

The two most sinister members of the ore pantheon lie 
at opposite ends of the visual spectrum. One is Shar- 
gaas, the Night Lord, god of darkness, night, and stealth. 
The other is Yurtrus the White-Handed, Lord of Mag- 
gots, the fearsome deity of plagues and death. 


Tieflings 

Humans with the blood of fiends, most tieflings in 
Faerun share a common connection due to the machina- 
tions of the archdevil Asmodeus a century ago. 

The Mark of Asmodeus 

During the Spellplague, Asmodeus consumed the 
divine spark of Azuth and thereby achieved godhood. 
Subsequently, Asmodeus and a coven of warlocks, the 
Toril Thirteen, performed a rite wherein the archdevil 
claimed all tieflings in the world as his own, cursing 
them to bear “the blood of Asmodeus.” This act marked 
all tieflings as “descendants" of the Lord of the Nine 
Hells, regardless of their true heritage, and changed 
them into creatures that resembled their supposed 
progenitor. The other folk of Faerun, unnerved by the 
appearance of these devil-beings, became suspicious of 
all tieflings and occasionally hostile to them. 

In spite of what some people believe, however, Asmo- 
deus exerts no power over his “children,” and tieflings 
today are as free-willed— and willful— as they ever have 
been. Some do choose to serve the Lord of the Nine 
Hells and his schemes, while others align themselves 
with different fiendish factions, or none at all, doing 
their best to stay out of infernal politics. 

Since the ritual that spread the curse of Asmodeus a 
century ago, tieflings have been born on Faerun that be- 
long to other infernal bloodlines, but those that bear the 
mark of the archdevil (and their descendants) remain 
the most numerous examples of their kind by far. 

Tieflings in Faerun generally have the racial traits of 
tieflings in the Player's Handbook, except that those not 


Tiefling Variants 

Since not all tieflings are of the blood of Asmodeus, some 
have traits that differ from those in the Player’s Handbook. 
The Dungeon Master may permit the following variants for 
your tiefling character, although Devil’s Tongue, Hellfire, 
and Winged are mutually exclusive. 

Appearance. Your tiefling might not look like other 
tieflings. Rather than having the physical characteristics 
described in the Player’s Handbook , choose ld4 + 1 of the 
following features: small horns; fangs or sharp teeth; a 
forked tongue; catlike eyes; six fingers on each hand; goat- 
like legs; cloven hoofs; a forked tail; leathery or scaly skin; 
red or dark blue skin; cast no shadow or reflection; exude a 
smell of brimstone. 

Feral. Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and your 
Dexterity score increases by 2. This trait replaces the Ability 
Score Increase trait. 

Devil’s Tongue. You know the vicious mockery cantrip. 
When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the charm person 
spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait. When you 
reach 5th level, you can cast the enthrall spell once with 
this trait. You must finish a long rest to cast these spells 
once again with this trait. Charisma is your spellcasting 
ability for them. This trait replaces the Infernal Legacy trait. 

Hellfire. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the burn- 
ing hands spell once per day as a 2nd-level spell. This trait 
replaces the hellish rebuke spell of the Infernal Legacy trait. 

Winged. You have bat-like wings sprouting from your 
shoulder blades. You have a flying speed of 30 feet. This 
trait replaces the Infernal Legacy trait. 


CHAPTER 3 | RACES OF THE REALMS 


descended from Asmodeus might exhibit different quali- 
ties; see the “Tiefling Variants’* sidebar. 

A Race without a Home 

As offspring of the infernal, tieflings call no place in 
Faerun their own, although some places and nations are 
more tolerant of them than most. 

In the North, the largest population of tieflings is 
found in Neverwinter. Since the Ashmadai, a violent cult 
dedicated to Asmodeus, is also active in the city, mis- 
trust of tieflings isn’t unusual even here, since folk never 
know if a tiefling is a member of the Ashmadai or was 
drawn to Neverwinter by the opportunity to blend in that 
a metropolis provides. 

Small and scattered groups of tieflings are found else- 
where across Faerun, particularly in cosmopolitan cities 
(where they can be anonymous to some degree) and in 
rough and poor settlements that welcome anyone who 
can help them survive and prosper. 

Tieflings are common in Calimshan, to the south, 
where many of them fought for the djinn as mercenaries 
and now serve other masters with the coin to pay them. 
In the east, many tieflings dwell in Aglarond— escaped 
slaves from Thay or their descendants— and in Mul- 
horand, where tieflings are believed to carry the blood of 
the ancient Mulhorandi gods themselves. 

Lone Faithful _ 

Although many Faerunian folk believe that all tieflings 
worship Asmodeus and the Lords of the Nine Hells, the 
truth is that only a fraction of them do so, but enough 
are devil- or demon-worshipers to lend the weight of 
truth to all the rumors and suspicion. 

Tieflings who revere a god other than Asmodeus often 
worship deities who watch over and care for outsiders, 
including Ilmater, Mask, Selune, Shar, and Tymora. 

Gods of knowledge, survival, cunning, and warfare are 
also common attractions for tieflings who value those 
qualities. Beshaba has tiefling worshipers who consider 
the accident of their birth as a kind of cruel joke they 
have chosen to embrace. 

Equally intriguing and disturbing to followers of 
some faiths in Faerun are stories spread by tieflings 
who claim to have visions in which the gods of Faerun 
appear to them modeled in the tieflings’ own image. One 
such is the entity they call the “pale horned goddess of 
the moon” (Selune); another is the “dark, devilish lady of 
fortune" (Tymora)— an indication, tieflings say, that one’s 
outward appearance and bloodline are less important to 
the gods than the heart and soul within. 

Tiefling Names 

A great many tiefling parents follow the naming conven- 
tions of the culture in which their offspring are born, 
such as using human names if they live in a human set- 
tlement (the better to seem like “normal” citizens). Oth- 
ers take names derived from the Infernal language that 
have been passed down since ancient times. 

In addition, some Faerunian tieflings have names 
drawn from the language of cultures where they are rel- 
atively common and generally accepted, such as Calish- 


Aasimar 

The celestial opposites of the tieflings, aasimar are de- 
scended from humans of celestial heritage. Aasimar 
aren’t as prevalent in the Realms as tieflings, but com- 
mon enough that some become adventurers. Dungeon 
Masters who want to allow their players to create aasimar 
characters can find rules for doing so in the Dungeon Mas- 
ter’s Guide. 


ite and Mulhorandi, which are foreign-sounding to folk 
in the North and along the Sword Coast. 

Al-Khem and Beni-Asmodai are two common Calish- 
ite tiefling surnames that proclaim the race’s heritage, 
along with first names such as Haroun, Ishaq, and Ni- 
zam (male) or Hania, Rashaa, and Zaar (female). 

Mulhorandi surnames that begin with “Sia” or “Zia” 
followed by a god’s name indicate a bearer of that god’s 
bloodline, such as Zianhur and Siasobek. First names 
commonly seen among Mulhorandi tieflings include 
Aybtep (“horned”), Bahati (“wise soul"), Het (“smoke”), 
Kamen (“dark”), Katsu (“star born”), and Kohl 
(“dark eyed”).

Chapter 4: Classes 



HE TWELVE CLASSES PRESENTED IN THE 
Player's Handbook are all found in the For- 
gotten Realms. The material in this chap- 
ter describes the place of those classes in 
Faerun, particularly on the Sword Coast 
and in the North. The chapter also in- 
cludes new class-feature options for most 
of the classes, as well as some new spells. 


Barbarians 


Closest to the dark elves, Pwent lowered his 
head, with its long helmet spike, and impaled one elf 
through the chest, blasting through the fine mesh of dr ow 
armor easily and brutally. The second drow managed to 
deflect the next battler ager’s charge, turning the helmet 
spike aside with both his swords. But a mailed fist, the 
knuckles devilishly spiked with barbed points, caught the 
drow under the chin and tore a gaping hole in his throat. 
Fighting for breath, the drow managed to score two nasty 
hits on his opponent’s back, but those two strikes did little in 
the face of the flurry launched by the wild-eyed dwarf. 

— R.A. Salvatore, Siege of Darkness 


Many of the lands of the Sword Coast and the North are 
savage, where day-to-day survival is a struggle. Such 
lands breed hardy tribes and fierce warriors, such as the 
Reghed and Uthgardt barbarians of the North and the 
seafaring Northlanders of the Moonshae Isles and the 
northernmost reaches of the Sword Coast. 

Barbarians of these lands are most often humans or 
half-ores, occasionally half-elves born of contact be- 
tween savage human tribes and the elves of the North 
or Western Heartlands, or tieflings from tribes known 
to consort with fiends. Dwarf barbarians are famed and 
feared warriors among the fiercely proud clans that have 
reclaimed territories like Mithril Hall and Gautlgrym. 
Barbarians of most other races hail from warmer south- 
ern lands, rather than the Savage North, although south- 
ern foundlings are sometimes adopted in the North and 
raised by tribes there. 

Primal Paths 

Barbarians in the Forgotten Realms have the following 
Primal Path options, in addition to those in the Players 
Handbook. Reghed and Northlander barbarians tend 
to follow the Path of the Berserker, while Uthgardt bar- 
barians are nearly always followers of the Path of the 
Totem Warrior. 

Path of the Battlerager 


into combat, striking with their body itself and giving 
themselves over to the fury of battle. 

Restriction: Dwarves Only 

Only dwarves can follow the Path of the Battlerager. 

The battlerager fills a particular niche in dwarven soci- 
ety and culture. 

Your DM can lift this restriction to better suit the cam- 
paign. The restriction exists for the Forgotten Realms. 

It might not apply to your DM’s setting or your DM’s ver- 
sion of the Realms. 

Battlerager Armor 

When you choose this path at 3rd level, you gain the 
ability to use spiked armor (see the “Spiked Armor" 
sidebar) as a weapon. 

While you are wearing spiked armor and are raging, 
you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon 
attack with your armor spikes against a target within 5 
feet of you. If the attack hits, the spikes deal ld4 pierc- 
ing damage. You use your Strength modifier for the 
attack and damage rolls. 

Additionally, when you use the Attack action to grap- 
ple a creature, the target takes 3 piercing damage if your 
grapple check succeeds. 

Reckless Abandon 

Beginning at 6th level, when you use Reckless Attack 
while raging, you also gain temporary hit points equal to 
your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). They vanish 
if any of them are left when your rage ends. 

Battlerager Charge 

Beginning at 10th level, you can take the Dash action as 
a bonus action while you are raging. 

Spiked Retribution 

Starting at 14th level, when a creature within 5 feet of 
you hits you with a melee attack, the attacker takes 3 
piercing damage if you are raging, aren’t incapacitated, 
and are wearing spiked armor. 

Path of the Totem Warrior 

If you follow the Path of the Totem Warrior from the 
Players Handbook , you have access to the options pre- 
sented here. 

Totem Spirit 

These options are available to you when you choose a 
totem animal at 3rd level. 


Spiked Armor 

Spiked armor is a rare type of medium armor made by 
dwarves. It consists of a leather coat and leggings covered 
with spikes that are usually made of metal. 


Known as Kuldjargh (literally “axe idiot") in Dwarvish, 
battleragers are dwarf followers of the gods of war and 
take the Path of the Battlerager. They specialize in 
wearing bulky, spiked armor and throwing themselves

As with the spirits in the Players Handbook , the op- 
tions here require a physical object incorporating some 
part of the totem beast, and you might acquire minor 
physical attributes associated with your totem spirit, 
such as a prominent nose if you have an elk totem spirit 
or catlike eyes if you have a tiger totem spirit. 


Also, your totem spirit might be an animal similar to 
one listed here but more suitable to your homeland, such 
as a horse or stag, rather than an elk, or a lion, panther, 
or other big cat, rather than a tiger. 

Elk. While you're raging and aren’t wearing heavy ar- 
mor, your walking speed increases by 15 feet. The spirit 
of the elk makes you extraordinarily swift. 

Tiger. While raging, you can add 10 feet to your long 
jump distance and 3 feet to your high jump distance. 

The spirit of the tiger empowers your leaps. 

Aspect of the Beast 

These options are available to you when you choose a 
totem animal at 6th level. 

Elk. Whether mounted or on foot, your travel pace is 
doubled, as is the travel pace of up to ten companions 
while they’re within 60 feet of you and you’re not inca- 
pacitated (see chapter 8 in the Player's Handbook for 
more information about travel pace). The elk spirit helps 
you roam far and fast. 

Tiger. You gain proficiency in two skills from the fol- 
lowing list: Athletics, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Survival. 
The cat spirit hones your survival instincts. 

Totemic Attunement 

These options are available to you when you choose a 
totem animal at 14th level. 

Elk. While raging, you can use a bonus action during 
your move to pass through the space of a Large or 
smaller creature. That creature must succeed on a 
Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your Strength bo- 
nus + your proficiency bonus) or be knocked prone 
and take bludgeoning damage equal to Id 12 +your 
Strength modifier. 

Tiger. While you’re raging, if you move at least 20 feet 
in a straight line toward a Large or smaller target right 
before making a melee weapon attack against it, you can 
use a bonus action to make an additional melee weapon 
attack against it. 

Bards 

Bards hold a special place of responsibility and respect 
in the Forgotten Realms. They are bearers of news, gos- 
sip, and messages in their travels from place to place, 
in addition to being living storehouses of history and 
folklore. Bards know a great deal, and they tend to be 
willing to share what they know, or at least barter for it. 

The arrival of a renowned bard is a special occasion, 
akin to the visit of a dignitary. A bard can reasonably 
expect at least a hot supper and a clean place to sleep 
from a local landlord or inn in exchange for a few songs 
or stories. A noble might host a bard in fine style— while 
also being careful to guard any secrets the noble’s 
household doesn’t want retold or sung across Faerun. 

Not all wandering performers are true bards, nor are 
all bards inclined to sing for their supper, although most 
will, given the need. Bards literally have magic to them, 
and the powers they command through their perfor- 
mance and lore earns them additional respect. 

In the Savage North, singers and storytellers called 
skalds are keepers of the history and great legends of 
the Northlanders and the Reghed. These warrior-poets

are the singers of the songs and sagas that fire the blood 
of warriors in battle, and composers of the new songs 
and sagas relating the mighty deeds of heroes and vil- 
lains. However, spellcasting is taboo among Reghed and 
Norhtlanders unless it is considered a gift of their gods. 
Characters with the bard class who rise to prominence 
among these folk must align themselves with their clan’s 
priests and shamans or risk being outcast. Most skalds 
are members of the College of Valor, as described in the 
Bard College class feature in the Player's Handbook. 

The Harpers 

Bards in the North and the Dalelands benefit from the 
existence of the Harpers, that legendary society recruit- 
ing bards and other independent agents to struggle 
against the forces of evil. Even though most bards in the 
region aren’t Harpers (and many who are don’t advertise 
that fact), common folk in the North often behave as if 
all bards are legendary wandering heroes, and are as 
likely to ask a bard for the solution to a problem trou- 
bling their community as they are a wandering fighter 
or wizard. This reputation cuts both ways, however, as 
some enemies of the Harpers suspiciously assume any 
humble minstrel might secretly be a Harper agent. 

Bardic Colleges 

In addition to the tradition of apprenticing with a master 
bard, the Sword Coast has some bardic colleges where 
masters teach students the bardic arts. They hark back 
to the great bardic colleges of the distant past, particu- 
larly the seven elder colleges: Fochlucan, Mac-Fuirmidh, 
Doss, Canaith, Cli, Anstruth, and Ollamh. These seven 
are said to be the origin of the instrument of the bards , 
each of which is named after one of the colleges. See 
chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for the game 
statistics of these magic instruments. 

Long ago, bards who sought the rank of master bard 
attended each of the elder colleges, seeking to learn its 
musical and magical secrets. Traditionally, the colleges 
were attended in the order given above, starting with Fo- 
chlucan. That tradition fell when the colleges went into 
decline, but some bards dream of restoring it. 

College of Fochlucan 

The original College of Fochlucan once stood on the 
northeastern edge of Silverymoon. Many years after it 
closed its doors, the site was reopened as Ultrumm’s 
Music Conservatory. The conservatory later moved to 
Southbank, and the House of the Harp occupied the 
college’s original location under the guidance of Master 
Bard Forell “Flamebeard” Luekuan, who sought to re- 
vive the ancient traditions and teachings of Fochlucan. 
Years of cultivation and support from Silverymoon, as 
well as the Harpers, yielded a faculty able to revive the 
college, and the House of the Harp adopted the Fochlu- 
can name once again. Most of its bards study and prac- 
tice the methods of the College of Lore, as described in 
the Bard College class feature in the Player's Handbook. 

The College of Fochlucan is naturally allied with the 
Harpers, although its master bards are careful to stress 
that its mission is separate from that of the Harpers. 



College of New Olamn 

Housed in two Cliffride villas overlooking the sea near 
Waterdeep, the College of New Olamn is a prestigious 
bardic college established in the Year of the Staff (1366 
DR) by wealthy Waterdhavian patrons and named for 
the old College of Ollamh. Students of the college un- 
dergo training in their chosen instruments, along with 
rigorous practice in memorization and the study of 
ancient songs, sagas, and history. Most bards of New 
Olamn belong to the College of Lore, as described in the 
Bard College class feature in the Player's Handbook. 

The Cliffride, a gravel path up Mount Waterdeep’s 
northern spur, is used to bring goods to the college, 
but most visitors and students use the Mount Melody 
Walk— a tunnel through the mountain itself— to reach it. 
The tunnel regularly resounds with music, thanks to the 
Neverending String of Pearls, an ongoing concert where 
bardic students perform in a small alcove in the tunnel, 
which carries and echoes their music. 


CHAPTER 4 I CLASSES 



College of the Herald 

Based at the great lore-house of Heralds Holdfast, 
northwest of Silverymoon, the College of the Herald is 
dedicated to the preservation of ancient history and leg- 
ends. The Heralds are charged with collecting and orga- 
nizing bodies of lore, which they make available to all of 
good and peaceful intent. Established by the Harper Ali- 
ost Oskrunnar in 922 DR, the Heralds are allies of the 
Harpers but remain neutral in most conflicts, dedicated 
to preserving knowledge above all else. 

The College of the Herald is less concerned with mu- 
sical performance (although it contains a considerable 
library of songs) and more with history, heraldry, and 
folklore, making it a key center of learning for bards of 
the College of Lore, as described in the Bard College 
class feature in the Players Handbook. 



Musical Instruments 

In addition to the common musical instruments listed in 
chapter 5, “Equipment,” of the Players Handbook , bards 
in the Realms play the following instruments: 

Birdpipes: Pan pipes or satyr pipes, also known as the 
shalm, these are sacred to Lliira and popular with 
wood elf and wild elf bards. 

Glaur: Short, curved horns like a cornucopia. Played 
with valves, glaur sound like trumpets, while 
those without valves, known as gloon, have a more 
mournful sound. 

Hand Drum: A double-headed skin drum fitted with 
handles along its side. 


Longhorn: A Faerunian flute of sophisticated make, 
found only in areas with skilled artisans, as in great 
cities or elven enclaves. 

Shawm: A double-reed instrument similar to an oboe or 
a bassoon, popular with gnomes, who have developed 
some bellows-powered versions. 

Songhorn: A recorder, a simple type of flute, usually 
carved from wood. 

Tantan: A tambourine, a popular instrument with 
halflings and humans south of the Dalelands. 

Thelarr: Also known as a whistlecane, a simple and 
easy-to-make wind instrument cut from a reed. They 
are so simple, in fact, that skilled bards frequently 
make and give them away to children— to the parents’ 
delight or regret. 

Tocken: A hanging set of carved oval bells, usually 
played with a pair of light wooden hammers (or open 
handed). They are most common in underground 
cultures, where the resonant tones can carry. 

Wargong: A metal gong, traditionally made from a 
shield, particularly the shield of an enemy. Both 
goblins and dwarves make and play wargongs, their 
sound echoing through tunnels in the Underdark. 

Yarting: A southern instrument from Amn and 
Calimshan that is a Faerunian analog to the guitar. 
Numerous variations have spread across the 
continent. 

Zulkoon: A complex pump organ that originated with 
the zulkirs of Thay, who use it in the casting of 
their spells. It is considered to have a dramatic, but 
sinister, sound. 


The Moonstars 

Over a century ago, the Harpers endured a schism. 

Khelben “Blackstaff” Arunsun was denounced by other 
Harper leaders for empowering Fzoul Chembryl, then the 
evil leader of the Zhentarim, with a powerful artifact. That 
Khelben did so in order that Fzoul destroy a dangerous 
lich mattered little. Khelben and Laeral Silverhand, his 
wife, left the Harpers then, taking with them certain agents 
and folding them into to a different organization, which 
Khelben had been secretly working to create for some time 
due to an old prophecy of the elves of Cormanthor. This 
group was the Moonstars, called Tel’Teukiira in Elvish. 
Although the Moonstars worked in concert at times with 
the Harpers, they also worked at cross purposes, and the 
Moonstars membership included many whom the Harpers 
considered too evil, such as a vampire. The Moonstars 
performed many good deeds, but their methods were 
often more brutal and pragmatic than the Harpers’ 
lofty ideals allowed. When Khelben died, the Moonstars 
seemed to collapse, and for many years the organization 
was assumed defunct. Yet during the Sundering, Moonstar 
sleeper agents reactivated the organization on a surpris- 
ingly massive scale, with members active in Candlekeep, 
Waterdeep, and Myth Drannor. The organization has 
since gone underground again. Their relationship to the 
present-day Harpers, Laeral Silverhand, and the current 
• Blackstaff of Waterdeep, Vajra, remains unclear. 



CHAPTER 4 | CLASSES 



Clerics 

The gods are most active through their chosen clerics, 
who carry out the gods’ work on the Material Plane. A 
typical cleric in Faerun serves a single divine patron, 
but some individuals feel called to serve a group, such 
as the elemental gods Akadi, Grumbar, Kossuth, and 
Istishia, while others serve deities that are intertwined 
gods, such as the elves’ Angharradh. 

Some clerics in Faerun belong to an established 
religious hierarchy, but many do not. The gods choose 
whomever they will, and sometimes a devoted wor- 
shiper is blessed with all the abilities of a cleric, despite 
not being a priest of any kind. That cleric might be a 
contemplative hermit, a wandering prophet, or simply 
a devout peasant. Religious orders often try to recruit 
such clerics and bring them into the fold, but not all of 
those clerics wish to be bound to a hierarchy. 

Conversely, not everyone who pursues a religious vo- 
cation is a true cleric. Some acolytes discover a different 
path for their lives than the path of the cleric. They serve 
their faiths in other roles, such as priests, scholars, or 
artisans, while some go on to vocations that have noth- 
ing to do with religion. A few souls who are denied the 
path of the cleric become embittered and seek favor with 
sinister or forbidden gods or forge pacts with other pow- 
erful entities. Religious scholars in the Realms debate 
whether divine rejection led such a person to embrace a 
dark path or whether the person was rejected because 
the gods foresaw the potential for darkness in the per- 
son’s future. The gods remain silent on the matter. 

Some clerics are homebodies who serve a particular 
community of the faithful, but adventuring clerics tend 
to have a certain crusading zeal to do their deity’s work 
in the wider world. This work may include ministering 
to far-flung communities, as well as seeking out and de- 
feating threats to the civilized world. 

Divine Domain 

Clerics in the Forgotten Realms have the following 
Divine Domain option, in addition to those in the Play- 
ers Handbook. 

Arcana Domain 

Magic is an energy that suffuses the multiverse and 
that fuels both destruction and creation. Gods of the 
Arcana domain know the secrets and potential of magic 
intimately. For some of these gods, magical knowl- 
edge is a great responsibility that comes with a special 
understanding of the nature of reality. Other gods of 
Arcana see magic as pure power, to be used as its 
wielder sees fit. 

The gods of this domain are often associated with 
knowledge, as learning and arcane power tend to go 
hand-in-hand. In the Realms, deities of this domain in- 
clude Azuth and Mystra. as well as Corellon Larethian 
of the elven pantheon. In other worlds, this domain 
includes Hecate, Math Mathonwy, and Isis; the triple 
moon gods of Solinari, Lunitari. and Nuitari of Krynn; 
and Boccob, Vecna, and Wee Jas of Greyhawk. 


Arcana Domain Spells

Arcane Initiate 

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain pro- 
ficiency in the Arcana skill, and you gain two cantrips 
of your choice from the wizard spell list. For you, these 
cantrips count as cleric cantrips. 

Channel Divinity: Arcane Abjuration 

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity 
to abjure otherworldly creatures. 

As an action, you present your holy symbol, and one 
celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend of your choice that 
is within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving 
throw, provided that the creature can see or hear you. If 
the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 min- 
ute or until it takes any damage. 





CHAPTER 4 | CLASSES 




Arcane Banishment 


Cleric Level 

Banishes Creatures of CR ... 

5th 

1/2 or lower 

8th 

1 or lower 

11th 

2 or lower 

14th 

3 or lower 

17th

Spell Breaker 

Starting at 6th level, when you restore hit points to an 
ally with a spell of 1st level or higher, you can also end 
one spell of your choice on that creature. The level of the 
spell you end must be equal to or lower than the level of 
the spell slot you use to cast the healing spell. 


Potent Spellcasting 

Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to 
the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip. 


A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move 
as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly end 
its move in a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t 
take reactions. For its action, it can only use the Dash 
action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it 
from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature 
can use the Dodge action. 

After you reach 5th level, when a creature fails its sav- 
ing throw against your Arcane Abjuration feature, the 
creature is banished for 1 minute (as in the banishment 
spell, no concentration required) if it isn’t on its plane of 
origin and its challenge rating is at or below a certain 
threshold, as shown on the Arcane Banishment table. 


Druid Circles 

Druidic ways are ancient and largely practiced in secret, 
away from the eyes of the uninitiated. In many lands, 
the Old Ways of the First Circle have given way to new 
churches and temples, but druids and their followers 
still gather to honor the cycles of nature and to ensure 
the natural balance isn’t threatened. People who dwell 
in or near wild lands do well to learn if a druid circle 
operates nearby, seeking the circle’s blessing before 
hunting or farming on the lands they protect. 

The druid habit of gathering in clearings, wooded 
groves, or around sacred pools gave rise to the tradition 
of circles. In a circle, all are equal, and while respect is 
given to age and accomplishment, the circle reaches de- 
cisions as a whole. Those who disagree are free to argue 
their point, or even to leave the circle, if they wish, but 
the circle acts as one for the good of all. Druid circles 
often include non-druid allies, such as rangers, wood 
elves, and the fey creatures of the land where the circle 
meets, all given equal voice. 

Numerous circles are found across Faerun, usually 
made up of no more than a dozen or so druids, plus 
their allies. They include the High Dance, guarding the 




Arcane Mastery 

At 17th level, you choose four spells from the wizard 
spell list, one from each of the following levels: 6th, 7th, 
8th, and 9th. You add them to your list of domain spells. 
Like your other domain spells, they are always prepared 
and count as cleric spells for you. 

Druids 

The druids of the Realms venerate nature in all its 
forms, as well as the gods of the First Circle, those 
deities closest to the power and majesty of the natural 
world. That group of gods includes Chauntea, Eldath, 
Mielikki, Silvanus, as well as Auril, Malar, Talos, and 
Umberlee, for nature is many-sided and not always kind. 

Unlike clerics, who typically serve a single deity, dru- 
ids revere all the gods of the First Circle in their turn, 
and see them as embodiments of the natural world, 
which moves in cycles: creation and destruction, waxing 
and withering, life and death. Thus, Grumbar isn’t just 
god of the earth to a druid; he is the fertile soil and the 
rolling hills themselves. Malar isn’t just the Beastlord, 
but the hunger and the hunting instinct of a preda- 
tory beast. 

Although they are most strongly associated with 
sylvan forests, druids care for all aspects of the land, in- 
cluding frozen mountains, burning deserts, rolling hills, 
and rough coasts.

Dancing Place in the high valleys of the Thunder Peaks, 
alongside their fey allies. The Watchers of Sevreld meet 
in Old Mushroom Grove in the High Forest, northeast 
•of Secomber, and the Starwater Circle gathers around 
their namesake pool in the northern forest of Mir. 

The Circle of Swords 

Protectors of the Neverwinter Wood, the Circle of 
Swords drives destructive humanoids like hobgoblins, 
bugbears, and their kin from the wood, while also safe- 
guarding it against exploitation at the hands of civilized 
folk and protecting the woods ancient ruins and sacred 
sites from looters. 

In the Druid Circle class feature in the Player's Hand- 
book, the Circle of the Moon is common for Circle of 
Swords druids, although some belong to the Circle of 
the Land (Forest). 

The Emerald Enclave 

Less a druid circle and more a loose confederation of 
circles and their allies, the Emerald Enclave is devoted 
to protecting the redoubt of civilization in the North 
from destruction. Elsewhere in the world, the Emerald 
Enclave must pursue a more balanced path, but the vast 
wilderness of the North holds far more danger to people 
than they pose to it. 

Founded in the Vilhon Reach over a thousand years 
ago, the Emerald Enclave has spread across much of 
Faerun. Its members include druids, rangers, barbar- 
ians, and others who live in the wilderness and know 
and respect its ways. They wear an article of emerald 
green clothing as a symbol of their membership, often 
bearing the emblem of a stags head. 

In the Druid Circle class feature in the Player's Hand- 
book, Emerald Enclave druids belong to the Circle of the 
Land and Circle of the Moon in equal measure. 

The Moonshea Circles 

The Ffolk of the Moonshea Isles venerate the land as 
the great goddess they call the Earthmother. Their cir- 
cles gather around sacred pools known as moonwells, 
their link between the natural world and the goddess, 
ringed by standing stone circles, raised by their ancient 
ancestors. 

In the Druid Circle class feature in the Player's Hand- 
book, Moonshea druids most often belong to the Circle 
of the Land (Coast, Forest, and Mountain). 

Moonwells 

The water of a moonwell, drunk directly from cupped 
hands, restores ld8 hit points, plus the drinker’s Wis- 
dom bonus, if any. If the drinker has threatened the bal- 
ance of nature since the last full moon, the water instead 
deals ld8 poison damage to the drinker. This damage 
is also dealt by a corrupted moonwell. Either effect oc- 
curs once only per day per drinker. On the nights of the 
full moon, drinking the water of a moonwell can, at the 
DM’s discretion, have additional effects, such as confer- 
ring the benefits of a lesser restoration spell. 


The Harpers and Druids 

Druid circles in the North are often allied with the Harpers, 
as they have common purpose, with bards and rangers 
serving as go-betweens. Individual Harpers can usually ex- 
pect a circle to at least grant them food and shelter, and an 
opportunity to attend a gathering and speak, if they wish. 

Still, the Harpers aren’t a druidic organization and, 
despite what some common folk might believe, not every 
druid or druid circle is allied with, or even friendly toward, 
the Harpers and their cause. Indeed, some druids consider 
the Harpers busybodies who threaten the natural balance 
almost as much as the evils that they fight against. 


Moonwell water placed in a container or taken more 
than 30 feet away from the well no longer has any of 
these properties; it is simply water. 

On the three nights of the full moon, three or more 
druids gathered around a moonwell can cast commune 
and scrying once each without expending spell slots and 
without material components, provided that one of the 
druids is at least 9th level and the rest are at least 4th 
level. At the DM’s option, the druids can use a moonwell 
on such nights to cast different spells. 

Fighters 

“Slow to learn, aren’t they?” a white-haired old 
knight who'd lost his helm in the last fray drawled. ‘ This is 
getting to be like a proper romp in the Dragonjaws , it is! I'll 
have to get my minstrel to write a ballad about this ..." 

“I hope he sings swiftly" a Purple Dragon armsman 
growled. “ Here they are!" 

The howling spilled over the bodies in another rushing 
tide of flapping leather, slashing swords, and beady goblin 
eyes. Men planted themselves— no running and leaping 
now— to hew steadily, like harvesters with scythes and many 
fields in front of them, in a rhythm of death. 

—Troy Denning, Death of the Dragon 

Whether doughty warriors, idealistic young soldiers, or 
hard-bitten mercenaries, fighters are found everywhere 
in the Forgotten Realms. Even the most peaceful lands 
have militia for protection against their enemies, and 
many great rulers in the Realms* past were fighters of 
some sort. There are always opportunities for those 
who know how to handle themselves in a fight. 

Able-bodied folk in many parts of the Sword Coast 
and the North learn at least the rudiments of combat 
as part of a local militia, serving in times of need, while 
a few go on to become professional soldiers, guards, 
or the like. Officers tend to come from the nobility, al- 
though there are opportunities for capable leaders to 
demonstrate their skills and rise through the ranks. 

Fighters who don’t make a career of soldiering find 
other ways to demonstrate their prowess. Mercenaries 
find employment with those who need skilled warriors 
but who lack the time or means to train them. Such 
employers include adventuring companies, which are 
almost always in need of a reliable fighter. 


CHAPTER 4 | CLASSES 



Merchants and guilds hire guards to protect caravans, 
ships, and their warehouses and guildhalls. Such work 
affords the opportunity for frequent travel and danger. 

A good deal of danger comes from fighters who aban- 
don legitimate employment to become bandits— raiding 
caravans, robbing travelers, and pillaging isolated home- 
steads, manors, and villages. Out-of-luck fighters might 
also take part in gladiatorial fights or similar blood 
sports to make a living off their skills, although such 
matches are virtually unknown on the Sword Coast and 
in the North, as compared to southern nations like Amn 
and Calimshan. 

Martial Archetype 

Fighters in the Forgotten Realms have the following 
Martial Archetype option, in addition to those in the 
Players Handbook. 

Purple Dragon Knight 

Purple Dragon knights are warriors who hail from 
the kingdom of Cormyr. Pledged to protect the crown, 
they take the fight against evil beyond their kingdom’s 


borders. They are tasked with wandering the land as 
knights errant, relying on their judgment, bravery, and 
fidelity to the code of chivalry to guide them in defeating 
evildoers. 

A Purple Dragon knight inspires greatness in others 
by committing brave deeds in battle. The mere pres- 
ence of a knight in a hamlet is enough to cause some 
ores and bandits to seek easier prey. A lone knight is a 
skilled warrior, but a knight leading a band of allies can 
transform even the most poorly equipped militia into a 
ferocious war band. 

A knight prefers to lead through deeds, not words. As 
a knight spearheads an attack, the knight’s actions can 
awaken reserves of courage and conviction in allies that 
they never suspected they had. 

Restriction: Knighthood 

Purple Dragon knights are tied to a specific order of 
Cormyrean knighthood. 

Banneret serves as the generic name for this arche- 
type if you use it in other campaign settings or to model 
warlords other than Purple Dragon knights. 

Rallying Cry 

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn 
how to inspire your allies to fight on past their injuries. 

When you use your Second Wind feature, you can 
choose up to three creatures within 60 feet of you that 
are allied with you. Each one regains hit points equal 
to your fighter level, provided that the creature can see 
or hear you. 

Royal Envoy 

A Purple Dragon knight serves as an envoy of the 
Cormyrean crown. Knights of high standing are ex- 
pected to conduct themselves with grace. 

At 7th level, you gain proficiency in the Persuasion 
skill. If you are already proficient in it, you gain profi- 
ciency in one of the following skills of your choice: Ani- 
mal Handling, Insight, Intimidation, or Performance. 

Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability 
check you make that uses Persuasion. You receive this 
benefit regardless of the skill proficiency you gain from 
this feature. 

Inspiring Surge 

Starting at 10th level, when you use your Action Surge 
feature, you can choose one creature within 60 feet of 
you that is allied with you. That creature can make one 
melee or ranged weapon attack with its reaction, pro- 
vided that it can see or hear you. 

Starting at 17th level, you can choose two allies within 
60 feet of you, rather than one. 

Bulwark 

Beginning at 15th level, you can extend the benefit of 
your Indomitable feature to an ally. When you decide to 
use Indomitable to reroll an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or 
a Charisma saving throw and you aren't incapacitated, 
you can choose one ally within 60 feet of you that also 
failed its saving throw against the same effect. If that 
creature can see or hear you, it can reroll its saving 
throw and must use the new roll.

Monks 

The fat man straightened his black-and-gold 
vest, lowered his round head, and charged. 

Danica waited until he was right in front of her, and to 
the onlookers it appeared as if the woman would be buried 
beneath mounds of flesh. At the last moment, she dipped 
her head under the fat man's lunging arm, caught his hand, 
and casually stepped behind him as he lumbered past. A 
subtle twist of her wrist stopped him dead in his tracks, and 
before he even realized what was happening, Danica kicked 
the back of both his knees, dropping him to a kneel. 

— R.A. Salvatore, Canticle 

Some of the earliest monastic orders in Faerun arose in 
the southern lands of Amn and Calimshan, their prac- 
tices migrating north and east at the same time similar 
practices filtered westward from distant Kara-Tur. 

The oldest orders have branched or fractured into 
smaller offshoots over time, such that there are now doz- 
ens of them. Most are no more than a few dozen mem- 
bers living in an isolated community in the wilderness. 
Some monastic communities have members numbering 
in the hundreds, with a presence closer to civilization, 
and often with correspondingly greater influence, for 
those orders concern themselves with worldly affairs. 

As most monastic orders in Faerun arose from human 
nations, the majority of monks in those communities 
tend to be human. Monasteries have long been sanc- 
tuaries for foundlings and outcasts of various sorts, so 
nonhuman monks are not unheard of. 

Monastic Orders 

The following orders can be found in various parts of 
the Forgotten Realms. 

The Dark Moon 

A monastic order devoted to Shar, the Dark Moon works 
openly in lands where her worship is accepted and in 
secret wilderness and underground hideaways where 
it isn’t. Its followers seek “knowledge and conversation 
with the shadow,’’ believing true wisdom is found in 
darkness and loss, both literally and spiritually. Its 
adherents most often follow the Way of Shadow, as de- 
scribed in the Monastic Tradition class feature in the 
Player s Handbook . 

The Hin Fist 

A halfling monastic order from Luiren, adherents of 
the Hin Fist turn their people’s natural confidence into 
a spiritual path for mastering themselves and their 
potential. A few Hin Fist masters have established mon- 
asteries in lands outside Luiren, where the teachings 
available only to halflings have been opened to students 
of other races who are willing to follow the path laid out 
by Yondalla. Hin Fist monks generally follow the Way of 
the Open Hand, as described in the Monastic Tradition 
class feature in the Players Handbook. 


Order of the Yellow Rose 

Also known as the Disciples of Saint Sollars the 
Twice-Martyred, the Order of the Yellow Rose is a soli- 
tary monastery of Ilmater worshipers in the Earthspur 
Mountains of Damara. It is known for loyalty to its al- 
lies and destruction to its enemies. Greatly respected 
on matters of truth and diplomacy, the monks work 
hard to survive in their remote sanctuary. The monks 
of the Monastery of the Yellow Rose use the remorhaz 
to test their disciples. Young monks must prove the 
power of their mind to overcome fear and pain by riding 
the beasts. 

The faith of Ilmater fosters far more orders of monks 
that other gods. Other llmatari monastic orders include 
the Followers of the Unhindered Path, the Disciples of 
St. Morgan the Taciturn, and the Sisters of St. Jasper of 
the Rocks.

Monks of Ilmater often travel as wanderers, begging 
for alms, seeking enlightenment, and relieving the suf- 
fering of others. They tend to follow the Way of the Open 
Hand, as described in the Monastic Tradition class fea- 
ture in the Players Handbook. 

The Sun Souls 

The Sun Soul monks follow a monastic tradition that 
they believe has its roots in the ancient empire of Neth- 
eril. In their philosophy, living things harbor a fragment 
of the sun’s mystic essence within them. Just as the body 
has a shadow, so too does the spirit have a light. That 
light is called the sun soul. Brothers and sisters of the 
Order of the Sun Soul train to tap into the “spiritual 
light within" and manifest it as supernatural feats of 
prowess and endurance. Members of this order follow 
the Way of the Sun Soul, which is described in the “Mo- 
nastic Traditions" section below. 

To get in touch with their internal light, Sun Soul 
monks follow a strict code of ascetic conduct called the 
Precepts of Incandescence. It emphasizes three pillars: 

Seek physical perfection. To open the way for the 

sun soul to manifest, one should strive to make the 
body beautiful. Fitness, cleanliness, and well-honed 
physicality create a clearer window through which the 
light can shine. 

Seek spiritual virtue. Recognize the light in others, not 
just the darkness. Grant and take each new chance to 
be virtuous. 

Shine light into darkness. Share the soul’s light with 
the world. Light up dark places with your presence 
and banish shadow. 

Due to the precepts' similarity to the teachings of 
some faiths, the Order of the Sun Soul has long had 
associations with temples and the faithful of three par- 
ticular deities: Sune, Selune, and Lathander. The dictate 
to seek physical perfection and recognize hidden virtue 
has similarity to Sune's teachings about physical and 
spiritual beauty. Followers of Selune recognize their 
goddess’s exhortation to battle darkness and seek vir- 
tue. And of course, Lathander’s association with the sun 
links to the Sun Soul philosophy, but more critically for 
worshipers of Lathander, they see the idea of granting 
and taking new chances as similar to Lathander’s em- 
phasis on new beginnings. 

Long Death Monks 

Followers of the Way of the Long Death worship the 
principle of death more so than any deity of death. 

These monks seek the secrets of life by studying death 
itself. It is the condition of being dead that concerns 
them most, and not what lies beyond; the afterlife holds 
little interest for them. Their monasteries are full of 
decaying, dying, and dead animal and plant specimens, 
which they study with detached interest. They frequently 
purchase rare specimens from adventurers and mer- 
chants that they can’t obtain easily themselves. But such 
studies are only part of the monks’ daily life: They seek 
to understand death as it pertains especially to intelli- 
gent living beings, and to this end they eagerly welcome 
the diseased and the dying so that they might watch and 


record their deaths. If such unfortunates seek release 
from pain through death, the monks provide it. They 
view death as a gift that they bestow on those who are 
ready for it. Their means of determining readiness vary 
from one sect (or even one monk) to another. 

The monks suffer no moral qualms about these deeds, 
for death is the most natural thing in the world, from 
their perspective, and to expire in service to its principle 
is one of the most profoundly holy experiences a living 
being can hope to enjoy. It is for this reason that the 
monks themselves do not fear death. 

Most of the order's members are either scholars who 
share mutual fascination with death and dying or clergy 
who worship one of the deities concerned with death. 
Some of the monks consider themselves to be nothing 
less than visionaries whose work will pave the way for 
a better future for all Faerun. When death is truly un- 
derstood, it can be harnessed and used as a tool for the 
betterment of all, or so they rationalize to themselves. 

Monks of this tradition follow the Way of the Long 
Death, which is described in the “Monastic Traditions” 
section below. 

The Yielding Way 

The monastic order of Eldath is the Disciples of the 
Yielding Way, sometimes known as the Brothers and 
Sisters of the Open Palm. These monks guard sacred 
sites where many priests dwell, and they travel the coun- 
tryside gathering information for isolated groves and 
fastnesses. They don’t ever seek to provoke violence, 
but are quite deadly when defending themselves, their 
charges, and their holy sites. 

Monastic Traditions 

Monks in the Forgotten Realms have the following 
Monastic Tradition options, in addition to those in the 
Player's Handbook. 

Way of the Long Death 

Monks of the Way of the Long Death are obsessed with 
the meaning and mechanics of dying. They capture 
creatures and prepare elaborate experiments to capture, 
record, and understand the moments of their demise. 
They then use this knowledge to guide their understand- 
ing of martial arts, yielding a deadly fighting style. 

Touch of Death 

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, 
your study of death allows you to extract vitality from an- 
other creature as it nears its demise. When you reduce 
a creature within 5 feet of you to 0 hit points, you gain 
temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier + 
your monk level (minimum of 1 temporary hit point). 

Hour of Reaping 

At 6th level, you gain the ability to unsettle or terrify 
those around you as an action, for your soul has been 
touched by the shadow of death. When you take this ac- 
tion. each creature within 30 feet of you that can see you 
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be fright- 
ened of you until the end of your next turn. 


CHAPTER 4 | CLASSES 



Mastery of Death 

Beginning at 1 1th level, you use your familiarity with 
death to escape its grasp. When you are reduced to 0 hit 
points, you can expend 1 ki point (no action required) to 
have 1 hit point instead. 

Touch of the Long Death 

Starting at 17th level, your touch can channel the energy 
of death into a creature. As an action, you touch one 
creature within 5 feet of you, and you expend 1 to 10 
ki points. The target must make a Constitution saving 
throw, and it takes 2dl0 necrotic damage per ki point 
spent on a failed save, or half as much damage on a suc- 
cessful one. 

Way of the Sun Soul 

Monks of the Way of the Sun Soul learn to channel their 
own life energy into searing bolts of light. They teach 
that meditation can unlock the ability to unleash the in- 
domitable light shed by the soul of every living creature. 

Radiant Sun Bolt 

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you 
can hurl searing bolts of magical radiance. 

You gain a ranged spell attack that you can use with 
the Attack action. The attack has a range of 30 feet. You 
are proficient with it, and you add your Dexterity modi- 
fier to its attack and damage rolls. Its damage is radiant, 
and its damage die is a d4. This die changes as you gain 
monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the 
Monk table. 

When you use the Attack action on your turn to use 
this special attack, you can spend 1 ki point to make two 
additional attacks with it as a bonus action. 

Searing Arc Strike 

At 6th level, you gain the ability to channel your ki into 
searing waves of energy. Immediately after you take the 
Attack action on your turn, you can spend 2 ki points to 
cast the lst-level spell burning hands as a bonus action. 

You can spend additional ki points to cast burning 
hands as a higher level spell. Each additional ki point 
you spend increases the spells level by 1. The maximum 
number of ki points (2 plus any additional points) that 
you can spend on the spell equals half your monk level 
(round down). 

Searing Sunburst 

At 1 1th level, you gain the ability to create an orb of 
light that erupts into a devastating explosion. As 
an action, you create an orb and hurl it at a point 
you choose within 150 feet, where it erupts 
into a sphere of radiant light for a brief but 
deadly instant. 

Each creature in that 20-foot-radius sphere 
must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or 
take 2d6 radiant damage. A creature doesn’t need to 
make the save if the creature is behind total cover that 
is opaque. 

You can increase the sphere’s damage by spending 
ki points. Each point you spend, up to a maximum of 3, 
increases the damage by 2d6. 


Sun Shield 

At 17th level, you become wreathed in a luminous aura. 
You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light 
for an additional 30 feet. You can extinguish or restore 
the light as a bonus action. 

If a creature hits you with a melee attack while this 
light shines, you can use your reaction to deal radiant 
damage to the creature. The radiant damage equals 5 + 
your Wisdom modifier. 

Paladins 

Some people are warriors of superior virtue. They ex- 
emplify a host of traits that folk consider honorable, just, 
and good. These warriors aspire to be the best people 
they can. When such a warrior also has great devotion 
to a particular deity, that god can reward the faithful 
with a measure of divine power, making that person 
a paladin. 

Different paladin orders in the Forgotten Realms 
emphasize different elements of righteous behavior, but 
all paladins are expected to hold true to a common set 
of virtues: 

Liberality. Be generous and tolerant. 

Good faith. Be honest and keep promises. 


CHAPTER 4 I CLASSES 


Courtesy. Treat others with respect despite how they 
treat you. Give honor to those above your station. Earn 
the respect of those below your station. 

Lawfulness. Laws exist to bring prosperity to those 
under them. Unjust laws must be overturned or 
changed in a reasonable fashion. 

Bravery. Gain glory through battle. Defend any charge 
unto death. 

Pride in one’s actions. Lead by example. Let your 
deeds speak your intentions. 

Humility in one’s deeds. Do not boast or accept 
rewards undue to you. 

Unselfishness. Share resources, especially with those 
who have the most need. 

Good-temperedness. Render service cheerfully and 
without disdain. 

Wisdom. Cause the most good through the least harm. 
Piety. Be faithful to the precepts of your god. 

Kindness. Protect the weak. Grant mercy to those who 
seek redemption. 

Honor. Hold true to the code. Death before dishonor. 

Every paladin grades and emphasizes these virtues 
based on his or her own personal ethos and religious 
background. A paladin of Sune would emphasize as- 
pects of courtly love and courtesy, whereas a paladin of 
Tyr would be more concerned with justice and fair treat- 
ment of foes. 

Most paladins in the Forgotten Realms, like clerics, 
are devoted to a particular deity. The most common 
paladin deities are those that embody action, decision, 
watchfulness, and wisdom. Torm and Tyr are both 
popular deities for paladins, as is Ilmater, who stresses 
self-sacrifice and the alleviation of suffering. Although 
less common, there are paladins of the following dei- 
ties: Helm, Hoar, Lathander, Sune, Corellon Larethian, 
the Red Knight, Clangeddin Silverbeard, Arvoreen, 
and Mystra. 

Their devotion to a higher ideal makes paladins pop- 
ular folk heroes in the Realms. Many tales are woven 
about noble knights and oath-sworn champions, al- 
though pragmatists note that the tales often end with a 
tremendous sacrifice on the part of said champions. 

The most common patrons of paladins of the Oath of 
Devotion and the Oath of the Crown (which is described 
below) are Helm, Torm, and Tyr— protection, courage, 
and justice— although Ilmater has his share of devoted 
champions. Those green knights sworn to the Oath of 
the Ancients might honor Arvoreen or Corellon, while 
avengers of the Oath of Vengeance follow patrons like 
Hoar, although there are also avengers of Helm and Tyr, 
meting out harsh justice. 

Paladin Orders 

The following orders can be found in various parts of 
the Forgotten Realms. 

Order of the Companion 

Based in Elturgard in the Western Heartlands, the Or- 
der of the Companion is sworn to guard that nation. It 
formed in the wake of the Spellplague and helped to cre- 
ate Elturgard, centered on the city of Elturel, overlook- 


ing the River Chionthar. The Companions safeguard civ- 
ilization against dangerous and wild forces, particularly 
unnatural creatures. Of the options in the Sacred Oath 
class feature, the Oath of the Crown (described below) 
and the Oath of Devotion (described in the Player's 
Handbook) are equally represented among their ranks. 

Order of the Gilded Eye 

The monastery and cathedral of Helms Hold stands on 
the edge of the Neverwinter Wood in the North as a safe 
haven for travelers. The Order of the Gilded Eye safe- 
guards the hold and serves the surrounding community, 
but their mission has a much broader focus: to guard the 
world from dangers originating on other planes of exis- 
tence, especially on the Lower Planes. Many paladins 
and non-paladins have joined the order in response to 
its call to cast fiendish incursions out of the world. In re- 
cent years, many have ventured forth from Helms Hold 
to do the order’s work in the wider world. 

Of the options in the Sacred Oath class feature in the 
Players Handbook , paladins of the Gilded Eye most 
often follow the Oath of Devotion, although a few zealots 
are followers of the Oath of Vengeance. 

Order of Samular 

The Holy Order of Samular, also known as the Knights 
of Samular, is made up of warriors in the service of Tyr. 
The order is based at Summit Hall, while also maintain- 
ing a chapter house in Waterdeep. Legendary paladin 
Samular Caradoon founded the order in 952 DR after 
the Second Troll War and the deaths of his brothers 
Renwick “Snowcloak” and Amphail the Just during the 
war. When Tyr fell silent and the paladins in his service 
lost their powers, many turned to other gods such as 
Torm, but the Rights of Samular stayed true to Tyr. 

Their patience was recently rewarded when, upon Tyr’s 
return to the world, many of their dwindling number 
were invested with the powers of a paladin. Known for 
their support of the law, many paladins of the order fol- 
low the Oath of the Crown, which is described below. 

Sacred Oath 

Paladins in the Forgotten Realms have the following 
Sacred Oath option, in addition to those in the Play- 
er's Handbook. 

Oath of the Crown 

The Oath of the Crown is sworn to the ideals of civili- 
zation, be it the spirit of a nation, fealty to a sovereign, 
or service to a deity of law and rulership. The paladins 
who swear this oath dedicate themselves to serving 
society and, in particular, the just laws that hold society 
together. These paladins are the watchful guardians on 
the walls, standing against the chaotic tides of barba- 
rism that threaten to tear down all that civilization has 
built, and are commonly known as guardians, exem- 
plars, or sentinels. Often, paladins who swear this oath 
are members of an order of knighthood in service to a 
nation or a sovereign, and undergo their oath as part of 
their admission to the order’s ranks. 


CHAPTER 4 | CLASSES 


Tenets of the Crown 

The tenets of the Oath of the Crown are often set by the 
sovereign to which their oath is sworn, but generally em- 
phasize the following tenets. 

Law. The law is paramount. It is the mortar that 
holds the stones of civilization together, and it must be 
respected. 

Loyalty. Your word is your bond. Without loyalty, 
oaths and laws are meaningless. 

Courage. You must be willing to do what needs to 
be done for the sake of order, even in the face of over- 
whelming odds. If you don't act, then who will? 

Responsibility. You must deal with the consequences 
of your actions, and you are responsible for fulfilling 
your duties and obligations. 

Oath Spells 

You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed. 

Oath of the Crown Spells 

Paladin Level Spells 

3rd command, compelled duel 

5th warding bond, zone of truth 

9th aura of vitality, spirit guardians 

13th banishment, guardian of faith 

17th circle of power, geas 

Channel Divinity 

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the follow- 
ing Channel Divinity options. 

Champion Challenge. You issue a challenge that com- 
pels other creatures to do battle with you. Each creature 
of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you 
must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a 
creature can’t willingly move more than 30 feet away 
from you. This effect ends on the creature if you are in- 
capacitated or die or if the creature is moved more than 
30 feet away from you. 

Turn the Tide. As a bonus action, you can bolster 
injured creatures with your Channel Divinity. Each 
creature of your choice that can hear you within 30 feet 
of you regains hit points equal to ld6 + your Charisma 
modifier (minimum of 1) if it has no more than half of its 
hit points. 

Divine Allegiance 

Starting at 7th level, when a creature within 5 feet of 
you takes damage, you can use your reaction to mag- 
ically substitute your own health for that of the target 
creature, causing that creature not to take the damage. 
Instead, you take the damage. This damage to you can’t 
be reduced or prevented in any way. 

Unyielding Spirit 

Starting at 15th level, you have advantage on saving 
throws to avoid becoming paralyzed or stunned. 

Exalted Champion 

At 20th level, your presence on the field of battle is an in- 
spiration to those dedicated to your cause. You can use 
your action to gain the following benefits for 1 hour: 


• You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and 
slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. 

• Your allies have advantage on death saving throws 
while within 30 feet of you. 

• You have advantage on Wisdom saving throws, as do 
your allies within 30 feet of you. 

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. 
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until 
you finish a long rest. 

Rangers 

Montolio held out his arm, and the great owl 
promptly hopped onto it, carefully finding its footing on the 
man's heavy leather sleeve. 

“ You have seen the drow?” Montolio asked. 

The owl responded with a whoo, then went off into a 
complicated series of chattering hoots and whoos. Montolio 
took it all in, weighing every detail. With the help of his 
friends, particularly this rather talkative owl, the ranger 
had monitored the drow for several days, curious as to why 
a dark elf had wandered into the valley. At first, Montolio 
had assumed that the drow was somehow connected to 
Graul, the chief ore of the region, but as time went on, the 
ranger began to suspect differently. 

— R.A. Salvatore, Sojourn 

Long have rangers walked the wilds of the Sword Coast 
and the Savage Frontier. Like druids, their practices 
date back to the earliest days of humanity. And long 
before humans set foot in the North, elf rangers strode 
through its forests and climbed its mountains. The tra- 
ditions and outlook of these people are now shared by 
members of many races. In particular, lightfoot halflings 
frequently hear the call of the wild and become rangers, 
often acting as guides and protectors of roving halfling 
bands, and shield dwarves forced to wander far from old 
clanholds sometimes follow the ranger’s path. 

Not every prospector wandering far hills or trapper 
hunting through uninhabited lands becomes a ranger. 
True rangers go out into nature and find it holy, and like 
paladins, they are touched by something divine. Their 
gods and creeds might differ, but rangers share similar 
values about the sanctity of nature. While by no means 
always aligned with one another, rangers are bound into 
a loose community of sorts— one that often connects 
with circles of druids. 

In the North and throughout much of the Heartlands, 
rangers use special marks to indicate campsites, dan- 
gerous areas, evil creatures, foul magic, goblinoid activ- 
ity, hidden caches of supplies, safe passage, shelter, and 
graves or tombs. Many of these symbols were derived 
from elven lore or borrowed from groups like the Harp- 
ers. While by no means a secret language, these trail 
marks are often obtuse to non-rangers, and even druids 
might not understand them. 

As a whole, rangers serve to help societies survive and 
thrive in the wilderness. Much of the Sword Coast and 


CHAPTER 4 | CLASSES 



133 



the North are unsettled. Rangers are driven to explore 
these lands, searching for fertile soil in which the seeds 
of civilization might grow, seeking resources (such as 
metals) that will benefit settled lands, or rooting out evil 
before it can spread. Other rangers spy on enemy troops 
or hunt down dangerous beasts or criminals. Given that 
so much of the North is frontier, rangers play a critical 
role in keeping communities safe and are often admired 
within them. 

Human Rangers 

Human rangers of the Moonshaes are devoted to the 
Earthmother, and those that work closely with druid 
circles on the mainland often honor the gods of the 
First Circle, but most rangers among humans favor the 
goddess Mielikki. However, they consider the goddess 
too wild and primal for them to pray to directly. Instead, 
they pray to Gwaeron Windstrom to bring their words to 
the goddess. Gwaeron is said to sleep in a grove of trees 
west of the town of Triboar, and most of his followers 
travel to that place at least once in their lives as a holy 
pilgrimage. Evil human rangers usually honor Malar for 
his ferocity and hunting skill. 


Elf Rangers 

Elf rangers are usually associated with a particular 
community such as Evereska or the tribes in the Misty 
Forest. Rather than being wandering explorers, elf 
rangers typically act as scouts and guardians of elven 
realms. Such elves usually devote themselves to Rilli- 
fane Rallathil or Solonor Thelandria. Elf rangers driven 
to roam might instead favor Fenmarel Mestarine, god of 
lone wanderers, or Shevarash, elven god of vengeance. 

Halfling Rangers 

Most halflings who revere nature and its raw beauty 
come from lightfoot stock. Their bands spend at least as 
much time on the road and river as in village and town, 
and the role of a ranger is a natural fit with the lifestyle 
of most lightfoots. Lightfoot rangers tend to favor the 
god Brandobaris in his aspect as patron of exploration. 
Halflings more inclined toward nature itself typically 
prefer Sheela Peryroyl. Those who devote themselves 
more to the protection of settlements or travelers honor 
Arvoreen. The few strongheart halflings who become 
rangers tend to favor those latter two deities. 

Dwarf Rangers 

Most dwarves prefer to hunker down under a mountain, 
rather than roam the wilderness of the surface or the 
Underdark. Most often, a dwarf ranger is either a shield 
dwarf cast out of a clanhold or a clanless dwarf seeking 
a place in the world. Sometimes dwarf rangers are pros- 
pectors who explore the world seeking new veins of ore. 
In any case, there are two deities who appeal to such 
dwarves: Marthammor Duin and Dumathoin. 

Rogues 

There are those whose abilities lie not with sword or the 
Art, but with quiet motion, dexterous action, and stealth. 
Such talents often lead to illegal endeavors, which 
plague most major cities, but can be placed to good use 
in dealing with dangerous monsters and lost treasure. 

Most large cities in the Realms have a number of 
thieves’ dens that compete with one another. A few 
places, such as Baldur’s Gate, have an organized group 
of rogues that controls all such activity. Most thieves’ 
dens are secret gathering spots, often beneath the city, 
and move after they’re discovered. 

The city of Waterdeep had once been home to the 
most powerful guild of thieves in the North: the Shadow 
Thieves. The Lords of Waterdeep smashed that guild, 
forcing its leaders to flee the city (the group still oper- 
ates out of Amn). There are still thieves and even assas- 
sins in Waterdeep, but they are broken into innumerable 
small groups or operate alone. 

The most common respite for such robbers is what 
they call the Honest Trade— adventuring, where rogu- 
ish abilities may be used without censure and are later 
lionized in song and legend. Many thieves take to this 
life, adhering to a code that keeps them out of trouble in 
civilized areas but still keeps them rich; they vow to bur- 
glarize ancient tombs and monstrous lairs instead of the 
homes and businesses of the wealthy in civilized lands. 


CHAPTER 4 | CLASSES 


Some rogues have learned it is easier to pick some- 
one’s pocket when you have a royal writ, which is to say 
many rogues are diplomats, courtiers, influence-ped- 
dlers, and information-brokers, in addition to the bet- 
ter-known thieves and assassins. Such rogues blend 
more easily into civilized society, more often acting as 
grease in the wheels than a wrench in the works. 

Roguish Archetypes 

Rogues in the Forgotten Realms have the following 
Roguish Archetype options, in addition to those in the 
Players Handbook. 

Mastermind 

Your focus is on people and on the influence and secrets 
they have. Many spies, courtiers, and schemers follow 
this archetype, leading lives of intrigue. Words are your 
weapons as often as knives or poison, and secrets and 
favors are some of your favorite treasures. 

Master of Intrigue 

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain 
proficiency with the disguise kit, the forgery kit, and one 
gaming set of your choice. You also learn two languages 
of your choice. 

Additionally, you can unerringly mimic the speech 
patterns and accent of a creature that you hear speak 
for at least 1 minute, allowing you to pass yourself off as 
a native speaker of a particular land, provided that you 
know the language. 

Master of Tactics 

Starting at 3rd level, you can use the Help action as a 
bonus action. Additionally, when you use the Help action 
to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that 
attack can be within 30 feet of you, rather than 5 feet of 
you, if the target can see or hear you. 

Insightful Manipulator 

Starting at 9th level, if you spend at least 1 minute 
observing or interacting with another creature outside 
combat, you can learn certain information about its 
capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if 
the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard 
to two of the following characteristics of your choice: 

• Intelligence score 

• Wisdom score 

• Charisma score 

• Class levels (if any) 

At the DM’s option, you might also realize you know 
a piece of the creature’s history or one of its personality 
traits, if it has any. 

Misdirection 

Beginning at 13th level, you can sometimes cause an- 
other creature to suffer an attack meant for you. When 
you are targeted by an attack while a creature within 5 
feet of you is granting you cover against that attack, you 
can use your reaction to have the attack target that crea- 
ture instead of you. 


Soul of Deceit 

Starting at 17th level, your thoughts can’t be read by 
telepathy or other means, unless you allow it. You can 
present false thoughts by making a Charisma (Decep- 
tion) check contested by the mind reader’s Wisdom (In- 
sight) check. 

Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would 
determine if you are telling the truth indicates you are 
being truthful, if you so choose, and you can’t be com- 
pelled to tell the truth by magic. 

Swashbuckler 

You focus your training on the art of the blade, relying 
on speed, elegance, and charm in equal parts. While 
some warriors are brutes clad in heavy armor, your 
method of fighting looks almost like a performance. Du- 
elists and pirates typically belong to this archetype. 

A Swashbuckler excels in single combat, and can 
fight with two weapons while safely darting away from 
an opponent. 

Fancy Footwork 

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn 
how to land a strike and then slip away without reprisal. 
During your turn, if you make a melee attack against a 
creature, that creature can’t make opportunity attacks 
against you for the rest of your turn. 



CHAPTER 4 I CLASSES 

M 


T 


Swashbucklers and Two-Weapon Fighting 

The Swashbuckler relies on a good understanding of the 
D&D rules to realize its potential, specifically when it 
comes to fighting with two weapons. Other characters 
must use an action to Disengage if they want to escape a 
melee, but the Fancy Footwork feature of the Swashbuck- 
ler bundles a more limited version of Disengage within 
your attack. This allows you to use your bonus action to 
fight with two weapons, and then safely evade each foe 
you attacked. 


Rakish Audacity 

Starting at 3rd level, your unmistakable confidence pro- 
pels you into battle. You can add your Charisma modi- 
fier to your initiative rolls. 

In addition, you don’t need advantage on your attack 
roll to use your Sneak Attack if no creature other than 
your target is within 5 feet of you. All the other rules for 
the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you. 

Panache 

At 9th level, your charm becomes extraordinarily beguil- 
ing. As an action, you can make a Charisma (Persua- 
sion) check contested by a creature’s Wisdom (Insight) 
check. The creature must be able to hear you, and the 
two of you must share a language. 

If you succeed on the check and the creature is hostile 
to you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against tar- 
gets other than you and can’t make opportunity attacks 
against targets other than you. This effect lasts for 1 
minute, until one of your companions attacks the target 
or affects it with a spell, or until you and the target are 
more than 60 feet apart. 

If you succeed on the check and the creature isn’t 
hostile to you, it is charmed by you for 1 minute. While 
charmed, it regards you as a friendly acquaintance. This 
effect ends immediately if you or your companions do 
anything harmful to it. 

Elegant Maneuver 

Starting at 13th level, you can use a bonus action on 
your turn to gain advantage on the next Dexterity (Ac- 
robatics) or Strength (Athletics) check you make during 
the same turn. 

Master Duelist 

Beginning at 17th level, your mastery of the blade lets 
you turn failure into success in combat. If you miss with 
an attack roll, you can roll it again with advantage. Once 
you do so, you can’t use this feature again until you fin- 
ish a short or long rest. 

Sorcerers 

The Weave of magic infuses every part of the Realms, 
and some people have the natural ability to perceive, 
touch, and shape the Weave. Some inherit this ability 
from a magical ancestor such as a dragon or an angel, 
others gain it by accident from exposure to wild magical 
power, and others manifest this power by chance or the 
hand of fate, perhaps portended by events at their con- 
ception or birth. 


Due to their varied origins and delayed manifestation 
of powers, sorcerers can be found almost anywhere 
and among almost any people. Larger cities on the 
Sword Coast— including Baldur’s Gate, Neverwinter, 
and Waterdeep— all have a few sorcerers, since people 
with magic gravitate to places where their abilities are 
valued. Sorcerers are slightly more common among 
cultures steeped in magic, such as among the elves of 
Evermeet and the humans of Halruua. The witches of 
Rashemen are sorcerers who lead that country’s society, 
but their Thayan neighbors often persecute the sorcer- 
ers who appear in Thay, seeing sorcery as a threat to the 
nation’s power structure, which is based on the study of 
wizardry. Magic-hating cultures, such as the Northland- 
ers and Uthgardt, exile or kill the sorcerers who mani- 
fest among them. 

Wild Magic 

The Forgotten Realms has a long history of magical 
disasters and uncontrolled surges of power that alter 
creatures or the land itself. Whether caused by a Neth- 
erese wizard trying to become god of magic, deities 
being forced to walk the earth during the Time of 
Troubles, or the chaos of the Spellplague, the magical 
chaos unleashed by such events has created a legacy of 
wild magic sorcerers. This legacy often lies dormant for 
generations, then suddenly manifests under the right 
(or wrong) circumstances. These wild mages are more 
common recently in lands directly affected by the Spell- 
plague, including Halruaa, Mulhorand, and pockets of 
Cormyr and the Sword Coast. 

Draconic Magic 

Dragons are known to take humanoid form and live 
among lesser creatures for decades. Some of these 
dragons have liaisons with humanoids, or invest their 
allies or minions with dragon magic. These invested 
creatures might become draconic bloodline sorcerers, 
or pass their abilities on to their descendants. Draconic 
bloodline sorcerers have appeared in most parts of the 
world due to the actions of individual dragons or exper- 
imentation by dragon cults, but they are significantly 
more common around Chessenta, which was once ruled 
by a dragon, and the land of Murghom near Thay, where 
dragon princes have ruled for the last eighty years. 

Magic of the Storm 

During the Sundering, a constant storm called the 
Great Rain covered the Sea of Fallen Stars, darkening 
the skies and causing massive floods. Thousands of 
people died from drowning, lightning strikes, or bursts 
of wind that hit like fists and capsized ships. A few survi- 
vors of these events found themselves blessed or cursed 
with innate magic— storm sorcerers able to bend light- 
ning, thunder, and wind to their will. Most of these new 
mages appeared near the Inner Sea, but clouds from the 
Great Rain sometimes traveled much farther away. Al- 
though not all storm sorcerers gained their powers from 
the Great Rain, most common folk associate them with 
its destructive weather and treat them with caution. 


CHAPTER 4 | CLASSES 







Sorcerous Origin 

Sorcerers in the Forgotten Realms have the following 
Sorcerous Origin option, in addition to those in the Play- 
er's Handbook. 

Storm Sorcery 

Your innate magic comes from the power of elemental 
air. Many with this power can trace their magic back to 
a near-death experience caused by the Great Rain, but 
perhaps you were born during a howling gale so power- 
ful that folk still tell stories of it, or your lineage might 
include the influence of potent air creatures such as 
vaati or djinn. Whatever the case, the magic of the storm 
permeates your being. 

Storm sorcerers are invaluable members of a ships 
crew. Their magic allows them to exert control over 
wind and weather in their immediate area. Their abili- 
ties also prove useful in repelling attacks by sahuagin, 
pirates, and other waterborne threats. 

Wind Speaker 

The arcane magic you command is infused with ele- 
mental air. You can speak, read, and write Primordial. 
(Knowing this language allows you to understand and 
be understood by those who speak its dialects: Aquan, 
Auran, Ignan, and Terran.) 

Tempestuous Magic 

Starting at 1st level, you can use a bonus action on your 
turn to cause whirling gusts of elemental air to briefly 
surround you, immediately before or after you cast a 
spell of 1st level or higher. Doing so allows you to fly up 
to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. 

Heart of the Storm 

At 6th level, you gain resistance to lightning and thunder 
damage. In addition, whenever you start casting a spell 
of 1st level or higher that deals lightning or thunder 
damage, stormy magic erupts from you. This eruption 
causes creatures of your choice that you can see within 
10 feet of you to take lightning or thunder damage 
(choose each time this ability activates) equal to half 
your sorcerer level. 

Storm Guide 

At 6th level, you gain the ability to subtly control the 
weather around you. 

If it is raining, you can use an action to cause the rain 
to stop falling in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on 
you. You can end this effect as a bonus action. 

If it is windy, you can use a bonus action each 
round to choose the direction that the wind blows in a 
100-foot-radius sphere centered on you. The wind blows 
in that direction until the end of your next turn. This fea- 
ture doesn’t alter the speed of the wind. 

Storm’s Fury 

Starting at 14th level, when you are hit by a melee at- 
tack, you can use your reaction to deal lightning damage 
to the attacker. The damage equals your sorcerer level. 
The attacker must also make a Strength saving throw 




Arcane Spellcasters 

The common folk of Faerun often make little distinction 
between sorcerers, warlocks, and wizards. Most mages see 
little point in kindling rivalries with other types of arcane 
spellcasters — magic is magic, regardless of the means — 
and for the most part, sorcerers, wizards, and warlocks 
respect each other as fellow practitioners of the Art, under- 
standing the power it represents. 

against your sorcerer spell save DC. On a failed save, 
the attacker is pushed in a straight line up to 20 feet 
away from you. 

Wind Soul 

At 18th level, you gain immunity to lightning and thun- 
der damage. 

You also gain a magical flying speed of 60 feet. As an 
action, you can reduce your flying speed to 30 feet for 1 
hour and choose a number of creatures within 30 feet 
of you equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. The chosen 
creatures gain a magical flying speed of 30 feet for 1 
hour. Once you reduce your flying speed in this way, you 
can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

Warlocks 


Given their dealings with often sinister otherworldly pa- 
trons in exchange for power, warlocks don’t have a ster- 
ling reputation in the Realms. Even well-meaning war- 
locks are viewed with suspicion and justifiable caution. 
Some wizards feel the very existence of warlocks taints 
the view of their noble Art and causes the common folk 
to view all practitioners of magic with doubt. 

Some warlocks, particularly those of fey or fiendish 
bloodlines, are born with a propensity for their power, 
drawing the attention of potential patrons even from 
childhood. Others seek out a pact, sometimes because 
they can’t find the power they desire elsewhere. Some 
warlocks forge multiple pacts, although they must even- 
tually come to favor one over the others, as their patrons 
are jealous and possessive beings. 


Patrons in the Realms 

The gods are far from the only forces at work in the 
Realms, and ambitious warlocks have many potential 
patrons able to offer them arcane power. 


The Archfey 


the Night Diamond or whispering secrets directly in 
the ears of her courtiers, and sometimes both at once. 

The Prince of Frost was once known as the Sun 
Prince, but his heart grew cold when his betrothed 
betrayed him and escaped, her soul becoming one 
of the stars. Ever since, the wrathful prince has 
sought to reunite with his betrothed whenever she is 
reincarnated in mortal form. 


The Fiend 


In the vast wilderness of the Realms one can still find 
connections to the Feywild. These are fey crossings, 
places of mysterious natural beauty in the world that 
have a near-perfect mirror in the Feywild. You can pass 
through a fey crossing by entering a clearing, passing 
through the surface of a pool, stepping into a circle of 
mushrooms, or crawling under the trunk of a tree. A few 
warlocks seek out such places to bargain with the Arch- 
fey of that realm for power. Noteworthy Archfey patrons 
include the following: 


Titania, the Summer Queen, is perhaps the mightiest 
of the archfey. With a smile, she can ripen a crop, and 
with a frown, summon wildfires. She rules the seelie 
of the Summer Court. 

Oberon, the Green Lord, an unrivaled hunter and 
woodland warrior, is Titania’s lover and frequently 
her foe. Oberon is attuned to every bough of each 
tree and each branch of every stream in the forests of 
the Feywild. If Oberon has a weakness, it is the wild 
nature of his heart. His mood swings like a weather 
vane in a wind storm. 

Hyrsam, the Prince of Fools, is thought to be the first 
satyr. He can sing the shine off gold, and his jokes 
and antics can cause stones to cry with laughter. Yet 
Hyrsam is also the soul of savagery and 
the wild. Hyrsam the Fool is a prankster 
and prone to mischief, but when such jokes 
turn vicious and deadly, Hyrsam the Savage 
is at play. 

The Queen of Air and Darkness rules the 
unseelie of the Gloaming Court from an 
onyx throne that sits empty except for the 
hovering Night Diamond, a black gem the 
size of a human head that dully glimmers 
with captured stars. The Queen of Air 
and Darkness is an invisible presence 
around it, her voice thundering from 


Numerous fiends forge pacts with mortal warlocks in 
the Realms— so many that warlocks are almost syn- 
onymous with infernal power in Faerun. These fiends 
include the Archdevils of the Nine Hells and their most 
powerful dukes, the Demon Lords of the Abyss, and the 
ultroloths who rule over yugoloth armies. Such deals 
need not be struck directly with the power in question, 
however. Often a weaker fiend serves as an intermedi- 
ary, and the warlock might not know whom he or she 
serves. Notable fiendish patrons peculiar to the Forgot- 
ten Realms include the following: 

Baazka is the pit fiend behind the most recent incursion 
of infernal forces from Dragonspear Castle. Its 
plans for the Sword Coast were thwarted along with 
those of allied Red Wizards, but its ambitions in the 
region remain. 


CHAPTER 4 | CLASSES 



Belaphoss is a demon that serves Demogorgon. It 
considers itself the greatest servitor of the Prince of 
Demons and thus a rival for Demogorgon’s power. 
Eltab was once bound beneath the city of Eltabbar in 
Thay, caged even by the layout of the city’s streets and 
canals, which formed a glyph of imprisonment. The 
demon is now loose in the world, seeking revenge. 
Errtu the balor has plagued Drizzt Do’Urden for more 
than a century, largely over possession of an artifact 
called the Crenshinibon. Having lost the last battle 
and been banished from the world, the balor now 
seeks indirect means of revenge. 

Gargauth is a mysterious infernal power who seeks 
godhood while trapped in the world within a 
magical shield. 

Lorcan is a cambion who collects warlocks like one 
might collect butterflies. His favorite collection, 
the Troil Thirteen, includes warlocks of blood 
descent from the thirteen who first made a pact 
with Asmodeus. 

Malkizid is a solar who fell from grace when he 
betrayed the Seldarine. Ever since then, Malkizid has 
delighted in every wrong he can do to elves, but he 
gains the greatest pleasure when he manipulates the 
elves into harming each other. 

Wendonai is the balor lord who first tempted the dark 
elves to summon demons in the ancient wars between 
the elf peoples. It also turned them to the worship of 
Lolth and continued to advise and tutor them for long 
after the Descent. 

The Great Old One 

Beyond the planes known to great wizards and sages 
lies the Far Realm of the Great Old Ones, beings outside 
time, space, and sanity. That realm is reachable by pro- 
fane rituals and in the dreams of some of those drawn to 
those entities’ power. Some of the blasphemous names 
associated with that place and its madness include the 
following: 

Dendar the Night Serpent, Eater of the World, is said 
to be the spawn of the first nightmare, devourer of 
foul visions, and harbinger of the end of the world. 

Her warlocks frequently dream of Dendar’s hiss and 
the dry rasp of her scales when they first realize their 
potential. 

Ghaunadaur, That Which Lurks, Underdark god 
of aberrations, also known as the Elder Eye. It is 
worshiped (if such a word can be used) by slimes, 
oozes, and similar creatures. 

Kezef the Chaos Hound is a black, skeletal mastiff 
covered in swarming maggots, its blood a black acid. 
The gods imprisoned Kezef in an unbreakable leash 
forged by Gond and a glowing ward conjured by 
Mystra, for which the Chaos Hound bit off Tyr's hand. 
Moander is a dark power of corruption and decay. 

Those touched by its influence first receive a dream, 
the “seed of Moander,” wherein the following words 
are heard: “Question not the words of Moander, lest 
you be stricken by the Eating From Within. Go forth 
and possess beings of power and influence for me. 
Slay, and let the rot cover all. Fear me, and obey.” 


Tyranthraxus, also called the Possessing Spirit and 
the Flamed One, seeks to rule the world through the 
bodies of others. Similar to the Earthmother, it uses 
magical pools as windows into the world to spread its 
influence. 

Zargon, the Returner, also called the Invincible Tyrant, 
is said to be an undying and unkillable evil. Some 
stories claim Zargon was the original master of the 
Nine Hells. Others claim him to be a powerful Demon 
Prince exiled from the Abyss. Perhaps neither of these 
stories are true, but it can surely be said that Zargon 
is a power that inspires madness and terror. 

Otherworldly Patron 

Warlocks in the Forgotten Realms have the following 
Otherworldly Patron option, in addition to those in the 
Players Handbook. 

The Undying 

Death holds no sway over your patron, who has un- 
locked the secrets of everlasting life, although such a 
prize— like all power— comes at a price. Once mortal, 
the Undying has seen mortal lifetimes pass like the sea- 
sons, like the flicker of endless days and nights. It has 
the secrets of the ages to share, secrets of life and death. 
Beings of this sort include Vecna, Lord of the Hand and 
the Eye; the dread Iuz; the lich-queen Vol; the Undying 
Court of Aerenal; Vlaakith, lich-queen of the githyanki; 
and the deathless wizard Fistandantalus. 

In the Realms, Undying patrons include Larloch the 
Shadow King, legendary master of Warlock’s Crypt, and 
Gilgeam, the God-King of Unther. 

Expanded Spell List 

The Undying lets you choose from an expanded list of 
spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following 
spells are added to the warlock spell list for you. 

Undying Expanded Spells 


Spell Level 

Spells 

1st 

false life, ray of sickness 

2nd 

blindness /deafness, silence 

3rd 

feign death, speak with dead 

4th 

aura of life, death ward 

5th 

contagion, legend lore 


Among the Dead 

Starting at 1st level, you learn the spare the dying can- 
trip, which counts as a warlock cantrip for you. You also 
have advantage on saving throws against any disease. 

Additionally, undead have difficulty harming you. If an 
undead targets you directly with an attack or a harmful 
spell, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw 
against your spell save DC (an undead needn’t make the 
save when it includes you in an area effect, such as the 
explosion of fireball). On a failed save, the creature must 
choose a new target or forfeit targeting someone instead 
of you, potentially wasting the attack or spell. On a suc- 
cessful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 


CHAPTER 4 | CLASSES 


hours. An undead is also immune to this effect for 24 
hours if you target it with an attack or a harmful spell. 

Defy Death 

Starting at 6th level, you can give yourself vitality when 
you cheat death or when you help someone else cheat it. 
You can regain hit points equal to ld8 + your Constitu- 
tion modifier (minimum of 1 hit point) when you succeed 
on a death saving throw or when you stabilize a creature 
with spare the dying. 

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until 
you finish a long rest. 


of madness brought on by delving too deeply into arcane 
lore, but they never say it too loudly anywhere a wizard 
might overhear. 

The greatest wizards of the Realms find means of 
extending their lives far beyond the span of any race 
except the elves. Archwizards may be centuries old, hav- 
ing seen civilizations rise and fall across Faerun. Other 
wizards seeking this longevity turn to lichdom, dwelling 
in isolated tombs and strongholds as they withdraw 
from the world in body as well as mind. 

Wizardly Groups 


Undying Nature 

Beginning at 10th level, you can hold your breath in- 
definitely, and you don’t require food, water, or sleep, 
although you still require rest to reduce exhaustion and 
still benefit from finishing short and long rests. 

In addition, you age at a slower rate. For every 10 
years that pass, your body ages only 1 year, and you are 
immune to being magically aged. 

Indestructible Life 

When you reach 14th level, you partake of some of the 
true secrets of the Undying. On your turn, you can use 
a bonus action to regain hit points equal to ld8 + your 
warlock level. Additionally, if you put a severed body 
part of yours back in place when you use this feature, 
the part reattaches. 

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until 
you finish a short or long rest. 

Wizards 

The First Hilt parried a clumsy axe swing and 
caught the rhythm of the wizard’s spell. It was one with 
which he was well familiar. Using his free hand, the 
bladesinger mirrored his opponent’s casting then sent his 
considerable power out to surround the overmatched 
wizard, binding it to himself. Argent energy flew from the 
human’s outstretched hand only to fizzle into nothingness 
as the bladesinger quenched the spell. 

—Keith Francis Strohm, Bladesinger 

Scholars and practitioners of what they call “the Art” 
(see chapter 1 for details), wizards are the most disci- 
plined spellcasters in the Forgotten Realms. They need 
to be, as their powers come from years of careful study 
and practice. Some wizards apprentice and study with 
an experienced master, while others attend formal acad- 
emies or universities of wizardry, such as those in Ever- 
meet or Halruaa, or in the great cities of the North like 
Waterdeep or Silverymoon. 

With the intensity of their study and practice, wizards 
tend to become increasingly solitary as they advance in 
their Art, having fewer peers with whom they can share 
their insights, if they choose to share them with anyone 
at all. Thus great wizards often take up residence in iso- 
lated towers or strongholds, exhibiting ever more eccen- 
tric behavior as time goes on. Some say this is a mark 


Many wizardly groups exist in the Forgotten Realms, 
but two, in particular, stand out. 



CHAPTER 4 | CLASSES 




The Red Wizards 

The most infamous group of wizards in the Realms are 
the Red Wizards of Thay. Garbed in their distinctive 
red robes, the Red Wizards have sought to expand 
their power and to extend Thay’s influence across 
the Realms, particularly in lands in the East. They 
shave their heads and wear complex tattoos reflecting 
their ambitions and achievements and their favored 
school of magic. 

In Thay, the Red Wizards have ultimate power, al- 
though they give governance of day-to-day affairs to 
those without skill in the Art. Every Red Wizard devotes 
study to one of the eight schools of magic and serves 
that schools zulkir, the leader and ultimate master of 
that style of magic. The zulkirs and their underlings 
constantly vie with one another for power and influence, 
and this competition frequently sends Red Wizards far 
from Thay to seek new spells, recover lost artifacts, and 
create wealth that can flow back to Thay. The power the 
Red Wizards hold in Thay gives them a measure of dip- 
lomatic legitimacy in the lands of the Sword Coast and 
the North, but their presence is rarely welcome and is 
universally viewed with suspicion. 

War Wizards 

The potential for wizards to influence the outcome of 
battle is something no ruler in Faerun can afford to 
ignore, and most great armies seek to recruit and in- 
clude wizards among their ranks. Evokers are the most 
common, simply for the potential their spells have of 
inflicting the most damage to the greatest number of en- 
emies. Still, all schools of magic find their applications 
in warfare. 

The War Wizards of Cormyr are perhaps the best 
known application of the Art to the field of battle. As 
much soldiers as they are scholars, many of them were 
members of the Purple Dragons before they began 
their training in the Art. In addition to field duty in 
times of war, the War Wizards also protect the royalty 
of Cormyr, and each one swears a magic oath of ser- 
vice to the Crown. In this role, War Wizards serve as 
bodyguards, advisors, and even spies. Members of the 
royal family, Purple Dragon Knights, and officers of the 
Purple Dragons frequently wear magic rings that allow 
a War Wizards to know where they've gone and to scry 
upon them. Removing such a ring, even for innocent 
reasons, can call a cadre of battle-ready War Wizards to 
teleport nearby with attack spells already in the midst of 
being cast. 

Arcane Tradition 

Wizards in the Forgotten Realms have the following 
Arcane Tradition option, in addition to those in the Play- 
ers Handbook. 

Bladesinging 

Bladesingers are elves who bravely defend their people 
and lands. They are elf wizards who master a school of 
sword fighting grounded in a tradition of arcane magic. 
In combat, a bladesinger uses a series of intricate, 










TT 


Mace Sicils 

Wizards and many other arcane spellcasters develop a 
signature rune, which they use to identify their belongings, 
sign as their name, and warn others. As a mage gains in 
power, more individuals recognize the sigil and connect 
it with a mighty spellcaster, not to be trifled with. Some 
mage sigils are used in conjunction with spells such as 
glyph of warding, which enforces the tendency of ordinary 
people to shy away from items marked by such sigils. 
There are folktales, in fact, about the gods themselves 
punishing a person who misuse’s a wizard’s sigil — prepos- 
terous tales that were most likely started by wizards 
themselves. There is no set penalty for violating another 
mage’s signature sigil or using it without permission. 
Powerful mages tend to punish such activity themselves to 
discourage further use. 

Apprentice wizards in Faerun are reminded of the 
dangers of misusing another spellcaster’s sigil by a rhyme: 
“Whenever magic one doth weave / ‘Tis never, ever, wise 
to deceive.” 



elegant maneuvers that fend off harm and allow the 
bladesinger to channel magic into devastating attacks 
and a cunning defense. 

Restriction: Elves Only 

Only elves and half-elves can choose the bladesinger 
arcane tradition. In the world of Faerun, elves closely 
guard the secrets of bladesinging. 

Your DM can lift this restriction to better suit the cam- 
paign. The restriction reflects the story of bladesingers 
in the Forgotten Realms, but it might not apply to your 
DM’s setting or your DM’s version of the Realms. 

CHAPTER 4 | CLASSES 





Bladesinger Styles 

From its inception as a martial and magical art, Bladesing- 
ing has been tied to the sword, more specifically the 
longsword. Yet many generations of study gave rise to 
various styles of Bladesinging based on the melee weapon 
employed. The techniques of these styles are passed from 
master to students in small schools, some of which have 
a building dedicated to instruction. Even the newest styles 
are hundreds of years old, but are still taught by their orig- 
inal creators due to the long lives of elves. Most schools of 
Bladesinging are in Evermeet or Evereska. One was started 
in Myth Drannor, but the city’s destruction has scattered 
those students who survived. 

Styles of Bladesinging are broadly categorized based on 
the type of weapon employed, and each is associated with 
a category of animal. Within that style are specializations 
named after specific animal types, based on the types of 
spells employed, the techniques of the master, and the 
particular weapon used. Bladesingers who apprentice 
to a master typically get a tattoo of their chosen style’s 
animal. Some bladesingers learn multiple styles and bear 
many tattoos, wearing a warning on their skin of their 
deadly skills. 

Cat. Styles that employ a sword belong to this family. 

The lion style, the eldest, trains practitioners in the use 
of the longsword and doesn’t favor any particular type of 
spells. Leopard style focuses on the shortsword and spells 
of illusion and stealth. Red tiger, a style just three centuries 
old, has its bladesingers using the scimitar in a whirling 
dance of defense from which they launch into sudden 
leaps and attacks. 

Bird. Styles that focus on the use of a hafted weapon, 
such as an axe or hammer, have been grouped together 
as bird styles, yet they vary wildly. All relatively new styles, 
they use weapons not typically favored by elves. Eagle-style 
bladesingers use small handaxes, and many maneuvers 
in the style focus on fluid ways to throw the weapon and 
draw a new one. Raven style uses a pick, and spells associ- 
ated with it grant the bladesinger more agility in combat. 

Snake. Practitioners of these styles use a flail, chain, or 
whip. Viper style uses a whip, despite its inelegance as a 
weapon, and has almost as long a history as the lion style. 
Its masters punctuate their bladesong with a stunningly 
rapid rhythm of whip cracks, which can keep many foes at 
bay and allow the bladesinger space to cast the cruel spells 
of poison and disease favored by the style. 


Training in War and Song 

When you adopt this tradition at 2nd level, you gain pro- 
ficiency with light armor, and you gain proficiency with 
one type of one-handed melee weapon of your choice. 

You also gain proficiency in the Performance skill if 
you don’t already have it. 

Bladesong 

Starting at 2nd level, you can invoke a secret elven 
magic called the Bladesong, provided that you aren’t 
wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield. It 
graces you with supernatural speed, agility, and focus. 

You can use a bonus action to start the Bladesong, 
which lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapac- 
itated, if you don medium or heavy armor or a shield, or 
if you use two hands to make an attack with a weapon. 
You can also dismiss the Bladesong at any time you 
choose (no action required). 


While your Bladesong is active, you gain the follow- 
ing benefits: 

• You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Intelligence 
modifier (minimum of +1). 

• Your walking speed increases by 10 feet. 

• You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks. 

• You gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throw 
you make to maintain your concentration on a 
spell. The bonus equals your Intelligence modifier 
(minimum of +1). 

You can use this feature twice. You regain all ex- 
pended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest. 

Extra Attack 

Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of 
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. 

Song of Defense 

Beginning at 10th level, you can direct your magic to ab- 
sorb damage while your Bladesong is active. When you 
take damage, you can use your reaction to expend one 
spell slot and reduce that damage to you by an amount 
equal to five times the spell slot’s level. 

Song of Victory 

Starting at 14th level, you add your Intelligence modifier 
(minimum of +1) to the damage of your melee weapon 
attacks while your Bladesong is active. 

Cantrips for Sorcerers, 
Warlocks, and Wizards 

Practitioners of the Art have developed the following 
cantrips for those who favor casting spells in melee. War 
Wizards of Cormyr, bladesingers, and warlocks of the 
Pact of the Blade are especially fond of these spells. 

These cantrips are on the sorcerer, warlock, and wiz- 
ard spell lists. 

Booming Blade 

Evocation cantrip 

Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 5 feet 

Components: V, M (a weapon) 

Duration: 1 round 

As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must 
make a melee attack with a weapon against one crea- 
ture within the spell’s range, otherwise the spell fails. 

On a hit, the target suffers the attack’s normal effects, 
and it becomes sheathed in booming energy until the 
start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves be- 
fore then, it immediately takes ld8 thunder damage, and 
the spell ends. 

This spell’s damage increases when you reach higher 
levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra ld8 
thunder damage to the target, and the damage the target 
takes for moving increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls 
increase by ld8 at 11th level and 17th level.

Chapter 5: Backgrounds 


HE BACKGROUNDS DESCRIBED IN THE 
Players Handbook are all found in 
m 1 Faerun’s various societies, in some 

ml form or another. This chapter offers 

m7 n J additional backgrounds for characters in 
a Forgotten Realms campaign, many of 
1 them specific to Faerun or to the Sword 
Coast and the North in particular. 

As in the Players Handbook , each of the backgrounds 
presented here provides proficiencies, languages, and 
equipment, as well as a background feature and some- 
times a variant form. For personality traits, ideals, 
bonds, and flaws, most of the backgrounds in this chap- 
ter use a thematically similar background in the Players 
Handbook as their foundation. 

City Watch 

You have served the community where you grew up, 
standing as its first line of defense against crime. You 
aren’t a soldier, directing your gaze outward at possible 
enemies. Instead, your service to your hometown was 
to help police its populace, protecting the citizenry from 
lawbreakers and malefactors of every stripe. 

You might have been part of the City Watch of Water- 
deep, the baton-wielding police force of the City of Splen- 
dors, protecting the common folk from thieves and rowdy 
nobility alike. Or you might have been one of the valiant 
defenders of Silverymoon, a member of the Silverwatch or 
even one of the magic-wielding Spellguard. 

Perhaps you hail from Neverwinter and have served 
as one of its Wintershield watchmen, the newly founded 
branch of guards who vow to keep safe the City of 
Skilled Hands. 

Even if you’re not city-born or city-bred, this back- 
ground can describe your early years as a member of 
law enforcement. Most settlements of any size have 
their own constables and police forces, and even smaller 
communities have sheriffs and bailiffs who stand ready 
to protect their community. 

Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Insight 
Languages: Two of your choice 
Equipment: A uniform in the style of your unit and 
indicative of your rank, a horn with which to summon 
help, a set of manacles, and a pouch containing 10 gp 

Feature*. Watcher’s Eye 

Your experience in enforcing the law, and dealing with 
lawbreakers, gives you a feel for local laws and crimi- 
nals. You can easily find the local outpost of the watch 
or a similar organization, and just as easily pick out 
the dens of criminal activity in a community, although 
you're more likely to be welcome in the former locations 
rather than the latter. 

Variant: Investigator 

Rarer than watch or patrol members are a community’s 
investigators, who are responsible for solving crimes 
after the fact. Though such folk are seldom found in 


rural areas, nearly every settlement of decent size has 
at least one or two watch members who have the skill to 
investigate crime scenes and track down criminals. If 
your prior experience is as an investigator, you have pro- 
ficiency in Investigation rather than Athletics. 

Suggested Characteristics 

Use the tables for the soldier background in the Players 
Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, 
modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your 
identity as a member of the city watch. 

Your bond is likely associated with your fellow watch 
members or the watch organization itself and almost 
certainly concerns your community. Your ideal probably 
involves the fostering of peace and safety. An investi- 
gator is likely to have an ideal connected to achieving 
justice by successfully solving crimes. 


The Stout Folk are well known for their artisanship 
and the worth of their handiworks, and you have been 
trained in that ancient tradition. For years you labored 
under a dwarf master of the craft, enduring long hours 
and dismissive, sour-tempered treatment in order to 
gain the fine skills you possess today. 

You are most likely a dwarf, but not necessarily— par- 
ticularly in the North, the shield dwarf clans learned 
long ago that only proud fools who are more concerned 
for their egos than their craft turn away promising 
apprentices, even those of other races. If you aren’t a 
dwarf, however, you have taken a solemn oath never 
to take on an apprentice in the craft: it is not for non- 
dwarves to pass on the skills of Moradin’s favored 
children. You would have no difficulty, however, finding 
a dwarf master who was willing to receive potential ap- 
prentices who came with your recommendation. 

Skill Proficiencies: History, Insight 
Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan’s tools 
Languages: Dwarvish or one other of your choice if you 
already speak Dwarvish 

Equipment: A set of artisan’s tools with which you are 
proficient, a maker’s mark chisel used to mark your 
handiwork with the symbol of the clan of crafters you 
learned your skill from, a set of traveler's clothes, and 
a pouch containing 5 gp and a gem worth 10 gp 

Feature: Respect of the Stout Folk 

As well respected as clan crafters are among outsiders, 
no one esteems them quite so highly as dwarves do. You 
always have free room and board in any place where 
shield dwarves or gold dwarves dwell, and the individu- 
als in such a settlement might vie among themselves to 
determine who can offer you (and possibly your compa- 
triots) the finest accommodations and assistance. 


Suggested Characteristics 

Use the tables for the guild artisan background in the 
Players Handbook as the basis for your traits and moti- 
vations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit 

CHAPTER 5 | BACKGROUNDS 


Clan Crafter

your identity as a clan crafter. (For instance, consider 
the words “guild" and “clan" to be interchangeable.) 

Your bond is almost certainly related to the master 
or the clan that taught you, or else to the work that you 
produce. Your ideal might have to do with maintaining 
the high quality of your work or preserving the dwarven 
traditions of craftsmanship. 

Cloistered Scholar 

As a child, you were inquisitive when your playmates 
were possessive or raucous. In your formative years, 
you found your way to one of Faerun’s great institutes 
of learning , where you were apprenticed and taught 
that knowledge is a more valuable treasure than gold 
or gems. Now you are ready to leave your home— not to 
abandon it, but to quest for new lore to add to its store- 
house of knowledge. 

The most well known of Faeruns fonts of knowledge 
is Candlekeep. The great library is always in need of 
workers and attendants, some of whom rise through 
the ranks to assume roles of greater responsibility and 
prominence. You might be one of Candlekeeps own, 
dedicated to the curatorship of what is likely the most 
complete body of lore and history in all the world. 

Perhaps instead you were taken in by the scholars 
of the Vault of the Sages or the Map House in Silvery- 
moon, and now you have struck out to increase your 


knowledge and to make yourself available to help those 
in other places who seek your expertise. You might be 
one of the few who aid Herald's Holdfast, helping to 
catalogue and maintain records of the information that 
arrives daily from across Faerun. 

Skill Proficiencies: History, plus your choice of one 
from among Arcana, Nature, and Religion 
Languages: Two of your choice 
Equipment: The scholars robes of your cloister, a 
writing kit (small pouch with a quill, ink, folded 
parchment, and a small penknife), a borrowed book 
on the subject of your current study, and a pouch 
containing 10 gp 

Feature: Library Access 

Though others must often endure extensive interviews 
and significant fees to gain access to even the most 
common archives in your library, you have free and easy 
access to the majority of the library, though it might also 
have repositories of lore that are too valuable, magical, 
or secret to permit anyone immediate access. 

You have a working knowledge of your cloisters per- 
sonnel and bureaucracy, and you know how to navigate 
those connections with some ease. 

Additionally, you are likely to gain preferential treat- 
ment at other libraries across the Realms, as profes- 
sional courtesy shown to a fellow scholar. 

Suggested Characteristics 

Use the tables for the sage background in the Players 
Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, 
modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your 
identity as a cloistered scholar. 

Your bond is almost certainly associated either with 
the place where you grew up or with the knowledge you 
hope to acquire through adventuring. Your ideal is no 
doubt related to how you view the quest for knowledge 
and truth— perhaps as a worthy goal in itself, or maybe 
as a means to a desirable end. 


Courtier 


In your earlier days, you were a personage of some 
significance in a noble court or a bureaucratic organiza- 
tion. You might or might not come from an upper-class 
family; your talents, rather than the circumstances of 
your birth, could have secured you this position. 

You might have been one of the many functionaries, 
attendants, and other hangers-on in the Court of Silvery- 
moon, or perhaps you traveled in Waterdeeps baroque 
and sometimes cutthroat conglomeration of guilds, no- 
bles, adventurers, and secret societies. You might have 
been one of the behind-the-scenes law-keepers or func- 
tionaries in Baldurs Gate or Neverwinter, or you might 
have grown up in and around the castle of Daggerford. 

Even if you are no longer a full-fledged member of the 
group that gave you your start in life, your relationships 
with your former fellows can be an advantage for you 
and your adventuring comrades. You might undertake 
missions with your new companions that further the 
interest of the organization that gave you your start 
in life. In any event, the abilities that you honed while

serving as a courtier will stand you in good stead as an 
adventurer. 

Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Persuasion 
Languages: Two of your choice 
Equipment: A set of fine clothes and a pouch 
containing 5 gp 

Feature: Court Functionary 

Your knowledge of how bureaucracies function lets you 
gain access to the records and inner workings of any no- 
ble court or government you encounter. You know who 
the movers and shakers are, whom to go to for the favors 
you seek, and what the current intrigues of interest in 
the group are. 

Suggested Characteristics 

Use the tables for the guild artisan background in the 
Players Handbook as the basis for your traits and moti- 
vations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit 
your identity as a courtier. 

The noble court or bureaucratic organization where 
you got your start is directly or indirectly associated 
with your bond (which could pertain to certain individu- 
als in the group, such as your sponsor or mentor). Your 
ideal might be concerned with the prevailing philosophy 
of your court or organization. 

Faction Agent 

Many organizations active in the North and across the 
face of Faerun aren’t bound by strictures of geography. 
These factions pursue their agendas without regard 
for political boundaries, and their members operate 
anywhere the organization deems necessary. These 
groups employ listeners, rumormongers, smugglers, 
sellswords, cache-holders (people who guard caches of 
wealth or magic for use by the factions operatives), ha- 
ven keepers, and message drop minders, to name a few. 
At the core of every faction are those who don’t merely 
fulfill a small function for that organization, but who 
serve as its hands, head, and heart. 

As a prelude to your adventuring career (and in prepa- 
ration for it), you served as an agent of a particular 
faction in Faerun. You might have operated openly or 
secretly, depending on the faction and its goals, as well 
as how those goals mesh with your own. Becoming an 
adventurer doesn’t necessarily require you to relinquish 
membership in your faction (though you can choose to 
do so), and it might enhance your status in the faction. 

Skill Proficiencies: Insight and one Intelligence, 
Wisdom, or Charisma skill of your choice, as 
appropriate to your faction 
Languages: Two of your choice 
Equipment: Badge or emblem of your faction, a copy 
of a seminal faction text (or a code-book for a covert 
faction), a set of common clothes, and a pouch 
containing 15 gp 

Factions of the Sword Coast 

The lack of large, centralized governments in the North 
and along the Sword Coast is likely directly responsible 
for the proliferation of secret societies and conspiracies 


in those lands. If your background is as an agent for one 
of the main factions of the North and Sword Coast, here 
are some possibilities. 

The Harpers. Founded more than a millennium ago, 
disbanded and reorganized several times, the Harpers 
remain a powerful, behind-the-scenes agency, which 
acts to thwart evil and promote fairness through knowl- 
edge, rather than brute force. Harper agents are often 
proficient in Investigation, enabling them to be adept 
at snooping and spying. They often seek aid from other 
Harpers, sympathetic bards and innkeepers, rangers, 
and the clergy of gods that are aligned with the Harp- 
ers’ ideals. 

The Order of the Gauntlet. One of the newest power 
groups in Faerun, the Order of the Gauntlet has an 
agenda similar to that of the Harpers. Its methods are 
vastly different, however: bearers of the gauntlet are 
holy warriors on a righteous quest to crush evil and pro- 
mote justice, and they never hide in the shadows. Order 
agents tend to be proficient in Religion, and frequently 
seek aid from law enforcement friendly to the order’s 
ideals, and the clergy of the order’s patron gods. 

The Emerald Enclave. Maintaining balance in the 
natural order and combating the forces that threaten 
that balance is the twofold goal of the Emerald Enclave. 
Those who serve the faction are masters of survival and 
living off the land. They are often proficient in Nature, 
and can seek assistance from woodsmen, hunters, 
rangers, barbarian tribes, druid circles, and priests who 
revere the gods of nature. 

The Lords* Alliance. On one level, the agents of the 
Lords’ Alliance are representatives of the cities and 
other governments that constitute the alliance. But, as a 
faction with interests and concerns that transcend local 
politics and geography, the Alliance has its own cadre 
of individuals who work on behalf of the organizations, 
wider agenda. Alliance agents are required to be knowl- 
edgeable in History, and can always rely on the aid of 
the governments that are part of the Alliance, plus other 
leaders and groups who uphold the Alliance’s ideals. 

The Zhentarim. In recent years, the Zhentarim have 
become more visible in the world at large, as the group 
works to improve its reputation among the common 
people. The faction draws employees and associates 
from many walks of life, setting them to tasks that serve 
the goals of the Black Network but aren’t necessarily 
criminal in nature. Agents of the Black Network must 
often work in secret, and are frequently proficient in De- 
ception. They seek aid from the wizards, mercenaries, 
merchants and priesthoods allied with the Zhentarim. 

Feature: Safe Haven 

As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network 
of supporters and operatives who can provide assis- 
tance on your adventures. You know a set of secret signs 
and passwords you can use to identify such operatives, 
who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, 
free room and board, or assistance in finding informa- 
tion. These agents never risk their lives for you or risk 
revealing their true identities. 


CHAPTER 5 | BACKGROUNDS 


Suggested Characteristics 

Use the tables for the acolyte background in the Players 
Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, 
modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your 
identity as a faction agent. (For instance, consider the 
words “faith” and “faction" to be interchangeable.) 

Your bond might be associated with other members of 
your faction, or a location or an object that is important 
to your faction. The ideal you strive for is probably in 
keeping with the tenets and principles of your faction, 
but might be more personal in nature. 

Far Traveler 

Almost all of the common people and other folk that one 
might encounter along the Sword Coast or in the North 
have one thing in common: they live out their lives with- 
out ever traveling more than a few miles from where 
they were born. 

You aren’t one of those folk. 

You are from a distant place, one so remote that few 
of the common folk in the North realize that it exists, 
and chances are good that even if some people you meet 
have heard of your homeland, they know merely the 


name and perhaps a few outrageous stories. You have 
come to this part of Faerun for your own reasons, which 
you might or might not choose to share. 

Although you will undoubtedly find some of this land’s 
ways to be strange and discomfiting, you can also be 
sure that some things its people take for granted will be 
to you new wonders that you’ve never laid eyes on be- 
fore. By the same token, you’re a person of interest, for 
good or ill, to those around you almost anywhere you go. 

Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Perception 
Tool Proficiencies: Any one musical instrument or 
gaming set of your choice, likely something native to 
your homeland 

Languages: Any one of your choice 
Equipment: One set of traveler’s clothes, any one 
musical instrument or gaming set you are proficient 
with, poorly wrought maps from your homeland that 
depict where you are in Faerun, a small piece of 
jewelry worth 10 gp in the style of your homeland’s 
craftsmanship, and a pouch containing 5 gp 

Why Are You Here? 

A far traveler might have set out on a journey for one 
of a number of reasons, and the departure from his or 
her homeland could have been voluntary or involuntary. 
To determine why you are so far from home, roll on the 
table below or choose from the options provided. The 
following section, discussing possible homelands, in- 
cludes some suggested reasons that are appropriate for 
each location. 

Why Are You Here? 

d6 Reason d6 

1 Emissary 4 

2 Exile 5 

3 Fugitive 6 

Where Are You From? 

The most important decision in creating a far traveler 
background is determining your homeland. The places 
discussed here are all sufficiently distant from the 
North and the Sword Coast to justify the use of this 
background. 

Evermeet. The fabled elven islands far to the west are 
home to elves who have never been to Faerun. They of- 
ten find it a harsher place than they expected when they 
do make the trip. If you are an elf, Evermeet is a logical 
(though not mandatory) choice for your homeland. 

Most of those who emigrate from Evermeet are either 
exiles, forced out for committing some infraction of 
elven law, or emissaries who come to Faerun for a pur- 
pose that benefits elven culture or society. 

Halruaa . Located on the southern edges of the Shin- 
ing South, and hemmed in by mountains all around, 
the magocracy of Halruaa is a bizarre land to most 
in Faerun who know about it. Many folk have heard 
of the strange skyships the Halruaans sail, and a few 
know of the tales that even the least of their people can 
work magic. 

Halruaans usually make their journeys into Faerun 
for personal reasons, since their government has a strict

CHAPTER 5 | BACKGROUNDS 


stance against unauthorized involvement with other 
nations and organizations. You might have been exiled 
for breaking one of Halruaa’s many byzantine laws, 
or you could be a pilgrim who seeks the shrines of the 
gods of magic. 

Kara-Tur. The continent of Kara-Tur, far to the east of 
Faerun, is home to people whose customs are unfamiliar 
to the folk of the Sword Coast. If you come from Kara-Tur, 
the people of Faerun likely refer to you as Shou, even if 
that isn’t your true ethnicity, because that’s the blanket 
term they use for everyone who shares your origin. 

The folk of Kara-Tur occasionally travel to Faerun as 
diplomats or to forge trade relations with prosperous 
merchant cartels. You might have come here as part of 
some such delegation, then decided to stay when the 
mission was over. 

Mulhorand. From the terrain to the architecture to 
the god-kings who rule over these lands, nearly every- 
thing about Mulhorand is alien to someone from the 
Sword Coast. You likely experienced the same sort of 
culture shock when you left your desert home and trav- 
eled to the unfamiliar climes of northern Faerun. Recent 
events in your homeland have led to the abolition of slav- 
ery, and a corresponding increase in the traffic between 
Mulhorand and the distant parts of Faerun. 

Those who leave behind Mulhorands sweltering des- 
erts and ancient pyramids for a glimpse at a different 
life do so for many reasons. You might be in the North 
simply to see the strangeness this wet land has to offer, 
or because you have made too many enemies among the 
desert communities of your home. 

Sossal. Few have heard of your homeland, but many 
have questions about it upon seeing you. Humans from 
Sossal seem crafted from snow, with alabaster skin and 
white hair, and typically dressed in white. 

Sossal exists far to the northeast, hard up against 
the endless ice to the north and bounded on its other 
sides by hundreds of miles of the Great Glacier and the 
Great Ice Sea. No one from your nation makes the effort 
to cross such colossal barriers without a convincing 
reason. You must fear something truly terrible or seek 
something incredibly important. 

Zakhara. As the saying goes among those in Faerun 
who know of the place, “To get to Zakhara, go south. 
Then go south some more. 1 ' Of course, you followed an 
equally long route when you came north from your place 
of birth. Though it isn’t unusual for Zakharans to visit 
the southern extremes of Faerun for trading purposes, 
few of them stray as far from home as you have. 

You might be traveling to discover what wonders are 
to be found outside the deserts and sword-like moun- 
tains of your homeland, or perhaps you are on a pilgrim- 
age to understand the gods that others worship, so that 
you might better appreciate your own deities. 

The Underdark. Though your home is physically 
closer to the Sword Coast than the other locations dis- 
cussed here, it is far more unnatural. You hail from one 
of the settlements in the Underdark, each of which has its 
own strange customs and laws. If you are a native of one 
of the great subterranean cities or settlements, you are 
probably a member of the race that occupies the place— 


but you might also have grown up there after being cap- 
tured and brought below when you were a child. 

If you are a true Underdark native, you might have 
come to the surface as an emissary of your people, or 
perhaps to escape accusations of criminal behavior 
(whether warranted or not). If you aren't a native, your 
reason for leaving “home” probably has something to do 
with getting away from a bad situation. 

Feature: All Eyes on You 

Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and per- 
haps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. 
Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, 
which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly 
interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, 
to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear 
stories of your homeland. 

You can parley this attention into access to people 
and places you might not otherwise have, for you and 
your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and 
merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in 
hearing about your distant homeland and people.

Inheritor 

You are the heir to something of great value— not mere 
coin or wealth, but an object that has been entrusted to 
you and you alone. Your inheritance might have come 
directly to you from a member of your family, by right 
of birth, or it could have been left to you by a friend, a 
mentor, a teacher, or someone else important in your 
life. The revelation of your inheritance changed your 
life, and might have set you on the path to adventure, but 
it could also come with many dangers, including those 
who covet your gift and want to take it from you— by 
force, if need be. 

Skill Proficiencies: Survival, plus one from among 
Arcana, History, and Religion 
Tool Proficiencies: Your choice of a gaming set or a 
musical instrument 
Languages: Any one of your choice 
Equipment: Your inheritance, a set of traveler’s clothes, 
any items with which you are proficient, and a pouch 
containing 15 gp 

Feature: Inheritance 

Choose or randomly determine your inheritance from 
among the possibilities in the table below. Work with 
your Dungeon Master to come up with details: Why is 
your inheritance so important, and what is its full story? 
You might prefer for the DM to invent these details as 
part of the game, allowing you to learn more about your 
inheritance as your character does. 

The Dungeon Master is free to use your inheritance 
as a story hook, sending you on quests to learn more 
about its history or true nature, or confronting you with 
foes who want to claim it for themselves or prevent you 
from learning what you seek. The DM also determines 
the properties of your inheritance and how they figure 
into the item’s history and importance. For instance, the 
object might be a minor magic item, or one that begins 
with a modest ability and increases in potency with the 
passage of time. Or, the true nature of your inheritance 
might not be apparent at first and is revealed only when 
certain conditions are met. 

When you begin your adventuring career, you can 
decide whether to tell your companions about your in- 


CHAPTER 5 | BACKGROUNDS 


heritance right away. Rather than attracting attention 
to yourself, you might want to keep your inheritance a 
secret until you learn more about what it means to you 
and what it can do for you. 

Inheritance 

d8 Object or Item 

1 A document such as a map, a letter, or a journal 
2-3 A trinket (see “Trinkets” in chapter 5 of the Player’s 
Handbook) 

4 An article of clothing 

5 A piece of jewelry 

6 An arcane book or formulary 

7 A written story, song, poem, or secret 

8 A tattoo or other body marking 

Suggested Characteristics 

Use the tables for the folk hero background in the Play- 
ers Handbook as the basis for your traits and motiva- 
tions, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit 
your identity as an inheritor. 

Your bond might be directly related to your inheri- 
tance, or to the person from whom you received it. Your 
ideal might be influenced by what you know about your 
inheritance, or by what you intend to do with your gift 
once you realize what it is capable of. 

Knight of the Order 

You belong to an order of knights who have sworn 
oaths to achieve a certain goal. The nature of this goal 
depends on the order you serve, but in your eyes it is 
without question a vital and honorable endeavor. Faerun 
has a wide variety of knightly orders, all of which have 
a similar outlook concerning their actions and respon- 
sibilities. 

Though the term “knight" conjures ideas of mounted, 
heavily armored warriors of noble blood, most knightly 
orders in Faerun don’t restrict their membership to such 
individuals. The goals and philosophies of the order are 
more important than the gear and fighting style of its 
members, and so most of these orders aren’t limited to 
fighting types, but are open to all sorts of folk who are 
willing to battle and die for the order’s cause. 

The “Knightly Orders of Faerun” sidebar details 
several of the orders that are active at present and is de- 
signed to help inform your decision about which group 
you owe allegiance to. 

Skill Proficiencies: Persuasion, plus one from among 
Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion, as appropriate 
for your order 

Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set or musical 
instrument 

Languages: One of your choice 
Equipment: One set of traveler’s clothes, a signet, 
banner or seal representing your place or rank in the 
order, and a pouch containing 10 gp 

Feature: Knightly Regard 

You receive shelter and succor from members of your 
knightly order and those who are sympathetic to its 


aims. If your order is a religious one, you can gain aid 
from temples and other religious communities of your 
deity. Knights of civic orders can get help from the com- 
munity— whether a lone settlement or a great nation— 
that they serve, and knights of philosophical orders can 
find help from those they have aided in pursuit of their 
ideals, and those who share those ideals. 

This help comes in the form of shelter and meals, and 
healing when appropriate, as well as occasionally risky 
assistance, such as a band of local citizens rallying to 


Knightly Orders of Faerun 

Many who rightfully call themselves “knight” earn that title 
as part of an order in service to a deity, such as Kelemvor’s 
Eternal Order or Mystra’s Knights of the Mystic Fire. Other 
knightly orders serve a government, royal family, or are 
the elite military of a feudal state, such as the brutal War- 
lock Knights ofVaasa. Other knighthoods are secular and 
nongovernmental organizations of warriors who follow 
a particular philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of 
extended family, similar to an order of monks. Although 
there are organizations, such as the Knights of the Shield, 
that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily 
being warriors, most folk of Faerun who hear the word 
“knight” think of a mounted warrior in armor beholden to 
a code. Below are a few knightly organizations. 

Knights of the Unicorn. The Knights of the Unicorn be- 
gan as a fad of romantically minded sons and daughters 
of patriar families in Baldur’s Gate. On a lark, they took 
the unicorn goddess Lurue as their mascot and went on 
various adventures for fun. The reality of the dangers they 
faced eventually sank in, as did Lurue’s tenets. Over time 
the small group grew and spread, gaining a following in 
places as far as Cormyr. The Knights of the Unicorn are 
chivalric adventurers who follow romantic ideals: life is to 
be relished and lived with laughter, quests should be taken 
on a dare, impossible dreams should be pursued for the 
sheer wonder of their completion, and everyone should 
be praised for their strengths and comforted in their 
weaknesses. 

Knights of Myth Drannor. Long ago, the Knights of Myth 
Drannor were a famous adventuring band, and Dove 
Falconhand, one of the famous Seven Sisters, was one 
of them. The band took its name to honor the great but 
fallen city, just as the new Knights of Myth Drannor do 
today. With the city once again in ruins, Dove Falconhand 
decided to reform the group with the primary goal of build- 
ing alliances and friendship between the civilized races of 
the world and goodly people in order to combat evil. The 
Knights of Myth Drannor once again ride the roads of the 
Dalelands, and they’ve begun to spread to the lands be- 
yond. Their members, each accepted by Dove herself, are 
above all valiant and honest. 

Knights of the Silver Chalice. The Knights of the Silver 
Chalice was formed by edict of the demigod Siamorphe 
in Waterdeep a century ago. Siamorphe’s ethos is the no- 
bility’s right and responsibility to rule, and the demigod is 
incarnated as a different noble mortal in each generation. 
By the decree of the Siamorphe at that time, the Knights of 
the Silver Chalice took it upon themselves to put a proper 
heir on the throne ofTethyr and reestablish order in that 
kingdom. Since then they have grown to be the most pop- 
ular knighthood in Tethyr, a nation that has hosted many 
knighthoods in fealty to the crown. 



CHAPTER 5 | BACKGROUNDS

aid a sorely pressed knight in a fight, or those who sup- 
port the order helping to smuggle a knight out of town 
when he or she is being hunted unjustly. 


Suggested Characteristics 

Use the tables for the soldier background in the Players 
Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, 
modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your 
identity as a knight of your order. 

Your bond almost always involves the order to which 
you belong (or at least key members of it), and it is highly 
unusual for a knight’s ideal not to reflect the agenda, 
sentiment, or philosophy of one’s order. 


Mercenary Veteran 

As a sell-sword who fought battles for coin, you’re well 
acquainted with risking life and limb for a chance at a 
share of treasure. Now, you look forward to fighting foes 
and reaping even greater rewards as an adventurer. Your 
experience makes you familiar with the ins and outs of 
mercenary life, and you likely have harrowing stories of 
events on the battlefield. You might have served with a 
large outfit such as the Zhentarim or the soldiers of Mint- 
arn, or a smaller band of sell-swords, maybe even more 
than one. (See the “Mercenaries of the North” sidebar for 
a collection of possibilities.) 

Now you’re looking for something else, perhaps 
greater reward for the risks you take, or the freedom to 
choose your own activities. For whatever reason, you’re 
leaving behind the life of a soldier for hire, but your 


skills are undeniably suited for battle, so now you fight 
on in a different way. 

Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Persuasion 
Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set, 
vehicles (land) 

Equipment: A uniform of your company (traveler’s 
clothes in quality), an insignia of your rank, a gaming 
set of your choice, and a pouch containing the 
remainder of your last wages (10 gp) 

Feature: Mercenary Life 

You know the mercenary life as only someone who has 
experienced it can. You are able to identify mercenary 
companies by their emblems, and you know a little about 
any such company, including the names and reputations 
of its commanders and leaders, and who has hired them 
recently. You can find the taverns and festhalls where 
mercenaries abide in any area, as long as you speak the 
language. You can find mercenary work between adven- 
tures sufficient to maintain a comfortable lifestyle (see 
“Practicing a Profession” under “Downtime Activities” in 
chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook). 

Suggested Characteristics 

Use the tables for the soldier background in the Player's 
Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, 
modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your 
identity as a mercenary.

Mercenaries of the North 

Countless mercenary companies operate up and down the 
Sword Coast and throughout the North. Most are small- 
scale operations that employ a dozen to a hundred folk 
who offer security services, hunt monsters and brigands, 
or go to war in exchange for gold. Some organizations, 
such as the Zhentarim, Flaming Fist, and the nation of 
Mintarn have hundreds or thousands of members and can 
provide private armies to those with enough funds. A few 
organizations operating in the North are described below. 

The Chill. The cold and mysterious Lurkwood serves as 
the home of numerous groups of goblinoids that have 
banded together into one tribe called the Chill. Unlike 
most of their kind, the Chill refrains from raiding the peo- 
ple of the North and maintains relatively good relations 
so that they can hire themselves out as warriors. Few city- 
states in the North are willing to field an army alongside 
the Chill, but several are happy to quietly pay the Chill 
to battle the Uthgardt, ores, trolls of the Evermoors, and 
other threats to civilization. 

Silent Rain. Consisting solely of elves, Silent Rain is a 
legendary mercenary company operating out of Evereska. 
Caring little for gold or fame, Silent Rain agrees only to 
jobs that either promote elven causes or involve destroy- 
ing ores, gnolls, and the like. Prospective employers must 
leave written word (in Elvish) near Evereska, and the Silent 
Rain sends a representative if interested. 

The Bloodaxes. Founded in Sundabar nearly two centu- 
ries ago, the Bloodaxes were originally a group of dwarves 
outcast from their clans for crimes against the teachings 
of Moradin Soulforger. They began hiring out as mercenar- 
ies to whoever in the North would pay them. Since then 
the mercenary company has broadened its membership to 
other races, but every member is an exile, criminal, or mis- 
fit of some sort looking for a fresh start and a new family 
among the bold Bloodaxes.

■ I 




Your bond could be associated with the company you 
traveled with previously, or with some of the comrades 
you served with. The ideal you embrace largely depends 
on your worldview and your motivation for fighting. 

Urban Bounty Hunter 

Before you became an adventurer, your life was already 
full of conflict and excitement, because you made a liv- 
ing tracking down people for pay. Unlike some people 
who collect bounties, though, you aren’t a savage who 
follows quarry into or through the wilderness. You’re 
involved in a lucrative trade, in the place where you live, 
that routinely tests your skills and survival instincts. 
What’s more, you aren’t alone, as a bounty hunter in the 
wild would be: you routinely interact with both the crim- 
inal subculture and other bounty hunters, maintaining 
contacts in both areas to help you succeed. 

You might be a cunning thief-catcher, prowling the 
rooftops to catch one of the myriad burglars of the 
city. Perhaps you are someone who has your ear to the 
street, aware of the doings of thieves’ guilds and street 
gangs. You might be a “velvet mask” bounty hunter, one 
who blends in with high society and noble circles in or- 
der to catch the criminals that prey on the rich, whether 
pickpockets or con artists. The community where you 
plied your trade might have been one of Faerun’s great 
metropolises, such as Waterdeep or Baldur’s Gate, or a 
less populous location, perhaps Luskan or Yartar— any 
place that’s large enough to have a steady supply of po- 
tential quarries. 

As a member of an adventuring party, you might find 
it more difficult to pursue a personal agenda that doesn’t 
fit with the group’s objectives— but on the other hand, 
you can take down much more formidable targets with 
the help of your companions. 

Skill Proficiencies: Choose two from among 

Deception, Insight, Persuasion, and Stealth 
Tool Proficiencies: Choose two from among one type of 

gaming set, one musical instrument, and thieves’ tools 
Equipment: A set of clothes appropriate to your duties 

and a pouch containing 20 gp 

Feature: Ear to the Ground 
You are in frequent contact with people in the segment 
of society that your chosen quarries move through. 
These people might be associated with the criminal 
underworld, the rough-and-tumble folk of the streets, 
or members of high society. This connection comes in 
the form of a contact in any city you visit, a person who 
provides information about the people and places of the 
local area. 

Suggested Characteristics 

Use the tables for the criminal background in the Play- 
ers Handbook as the basis for your bounty hunter’s 
traits and motivations, modifying the entries when ap- 
propriate to suit your identity as a bounty hunter. 

For instance, your bond might involve other bounty 
hunters or the organizations or individuals that employ 



you. Your ideal could be associated with your determina- 
tion always to catch your quarry or your desire to main- 
tain your reputation for being dependable. 

Uthgardt Tribe Member 

Though you might have only recently arrived in civilized 
lands, you are no stranger to the values of cooperation 
and group effort when striving for supremacy. You 
learned these principles, and much more, as a member 
of an Uthgardt tribe. 

Your people have always tried to hold to the old ways. 
Tradition and taboo have kept the Uthgardt strong 
while the kingdoms of others have collapsed into chaos 
and ruin. But for the last few generations, some bands 
among the tribes were tempted to settle, make peace, 
trade, and even to build towns. Perhaps this is why Uth- 
gar chose to raise up the totems among the people as 
living embodiments of his power. Perhaps they needed a 
reminder of who they were and from whence they came. 
The Chosen of Uthgar led bands back to the old ways, 
and most of your people abandoned the soft ways of 
civilization. 



CHAPTER 5 I B AC KG I

Barbarian Tribes of FaerOn 

Though this section details the Uthgardt specifically, either 
it or the outlander background from the Player's Handbook 
can be used for a character whose origin lies with one of 
the other barbarian tribes in Faerun. 

You might be a fair-haired barbarian of the Reghed, 
dwelling in the shadow of the Reghed Glacier in the far 
North near Icewind Dale. You might also be of the no- 
madic Rashemi, noted for their savage berserkers and their 
masked witches. Perhaps you hail from one of the wood 
elf tribes in the Chondalwood, or the magic-hating human 
tribes of the sweltering jungles of Chult. 


You might have grown up in one of the tribes that had 
decided to settle down, and now that they have aban- 
doned that path, you find yourself adrift. Or you might 
come from a segment of the Uthgardt that adheres to 
tradition, but you seek to bring glory to your tribe by 
achieving great things as a formidable adventurer. 

See the “Uthgardt Lands” section of chapter 2 for de- 
tails on each tribe’s territory and its activities that will 
help you choose your affiliation. 

Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Survival 
Tool Proficiencies: One type of musical instrument or 
artisans tools 

Languages: One of your choice 
Equipment: A hunting trap, a totemic token or set 
of tattoos marking your loyalty to Uthgar and your 
tribal totem, a set of travelers clothes, and a pouch 
containing 10 gp 

Feature: Uthgardt Heritage 

You have an excellent knowledge of not only your tribe’s 
territory, but also the terrain and natural resources of 
the rest of the North. You are familiar enough with any 
wilderness area that you find twice as much food and 
water as you normally would when you forage there. 

Additionally, you can call upon the hospitality of 
your people, and those folk allied with your tribe, often 
including members of druid circles, tribes of nomadic 
elves, the Harpers, and the priesthoods devoted to the 
gods of the First Circle. 

Suggested Characteristics 

Use the tables for the outlander background in the 
Players Handbook as the basis for your traits and moti- 
vations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit 
your identity as a member of an Uthgardt tribe. 

Even if you have left your tribe behind (at least for 
now), you hold to the traditions of your people. You will 
never cut down a still-living tree, and you may not coun- 
tenance such an act being done in your presence. The 
Uthgardt ancestral mounds— great hills where the totem 
spirits were defeated by Uthgar and where the heroes of 
the tribes are interred— are sacred to you. 

Your bond is undoubtedly associated with your tribe 
or some aspect of Uthgardt philosophy or culture (per- 
haps even Uthgar himself). Your ideal is a personal 
choice that probably hews closely to the ethos of your 
people and certainly doesn’t contradict or compromise 
what being an Uthgardt stands for. 


Waterdhavian Noble 

You are a scion of one of the great noble families of Wa- 
terdeep. Human families who jealously guard their priv- 
ilege and place in the City of Splendors, Waterdhavian 
nobles have a reputation across Faerun for being eccen- 
tric, spoiled, venal, and, above all else, rich. 

Whether you are a shining example of the reason 
for this reputation or one who proves the rule by being 
an exception, people expect things of you when they 
know your surname and what it means. Your reasons 
for taking up adventuring likely involve your family in 
some way: Are you the family rebel, who prefers delv- 
ing in filthy dungeons to sipping zzar at a ball? Or have 
you taken up sword or spell on your family’s behalf, 
ensuring that they have someone of renown to see to 
their legacy? 

Work with your DM to come up with the family you 
are part of —there are around seventy-five lineages in 
Waterdeep, each with its own financial interests, spe- 
cialties, and schemes. You might be part of the main line 
of your family, possibly in line to become its leader one 
day. Or you might be one of any number of cousins, with 
less prestige but also less responsibility. 

Skill Proficiencies: History, Persuasion 

Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set or one 

musical instrument 
Languages: One of your choice 
Equipment: A set of fine clothes, a signet ring or 

brooch, a scroll of pedigree, a skin of fine zzar or 

wine, and a purse containing 20 gp 

Feature: Kept in Style 

While you are in Waterdeep or elsewhere in the North, 
your house sees to your everyday needs. Your name and 
signet are sufficient to cover most of your expenses; the 
inns, taverns, and festhalls you frequent are glad to re- 
cord your debt and send an accounting to your family’s 
estate in Waterdeep to settle what you owe. 

This advantage enables you to live a comfortable life- 
style without having to pay 2 gp a day for it, or reduces 
the cost of a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle by that 
amount. You may not maintain a less affluent lifestyle 
and use the difference as income— the benefit is a line of 
credit, not an actual monetary reward. 

Suggested Characteristics 

Use the tables for the noble background in the Players 
Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, 
modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your 
identity as a member of a Waterdhavian family. 

Like other nobles, you were born and raised in a dif- 
ferent world from the one that most folk know— one that 
grants you privilege but also calls you to fulfill a duty be- 
fitting your station. Your bond might be associated with 
your family alone, or it could be concerned with another 
noble house that sides with or opposes your own. Your 
ideal depends to some extent on how you view your role 
in the family, and how you intend to conduct yourself in 
the world at large as a representative of your house.

Appendix: Class Options in Other Worlds 


HE CLASS OPTIONS IN THIS BOOK ARE 
designed for the Forgotten Realms, but 
I they can be easily transported to other offi- 
■ ^ cial D&D worlds or to a world of your own 

7 n J creation. This appendix offers suggestions 
for modifying names and other elements of 
1 the character options in chapter 4. 

None of the statements here should be treated as 
canonical for the D&D settings discussed. Instead, 
take them in the spirit of advice given from one DM to 
another on how to integrate these new character options 
into your campaign. 

Dragonlance 

Use the following guidelines to adapt this book’s class 
options to a campaign set on Krynn. 

Barbarian 

Barbarians are most common among Kagonesti elves 
and human nomad tribes. Both groups have a healthy 
respect for the land and its creatures, and the tiger and 
elk totems both have devotees among them. While the 
folk of Ansalon know of elk, the griffon replaces the ti- 
ger as an object of respect. 

The battlerager has no equivalent in the Dragonlance 
saga. A character opting for the Path of the Battlerager 
might be part of a gnomish attempt at inventing a new 
sort of armor, an effort that yielded a dangerous but 
effective fighting style. It’s up to the player whether the 
barbarian’s rage stems from a set of tactics developed 
for use with the gnome-created spiked armor or from 
sheer frustration at having to turn to the mad tinker 
gnomes for help. 

Cleric 

The Arcana Domain has no established place in Drag- 
onlance. The gods of magic are patrons of the Wizards 
of High Sorcery. Spellcasters revere the deity appro- 
priate to their order through the study and mastery of 
arcane magic, rather than through divine power. How- 
ever, clerics devoted to the neutral gods Gilean (god of 
knowledge) and Zivilyn (god of wisdom) might have the 
Arcana Domain. 

Fighter 


but most prefer the martial aspect of the Way of the 
Open Hand. 

The Way of the Sun Soul could be used to represent 
followers of Sirrion, god of creativity, passion, fighters, 
and fire. Sirrion is said to sculpt the fire of the soul, and 
these monks seek to sculpt their minds and bodies so 
that all three act in unison, making instinct and action 
one and the same. 

Paladin 

The Oath of the Crown is a perfect match for any pal- 
adin who is a member of the Knights of the Sword or 
Knights of the Skull. Both orders swear fealty to an or- 
ganization and combine spellcasting and martial skill. 

Rogue 

The Mastermind matches well with any character of 
cunning, intelligence, and insight who might be involved 
in court intrigue. But it also serves as a good way to por- 
tray a cunning pirate captain from the Blood Sea Isles. 

The Swashbuckler provides another option for char- 
acters who hail from that region. Serving as pirates 
or mariners plying the Blood Sea, a Swashbuckler’s 
emphasis on speed and light armor is ideal for an 
environment where heavy armor is little more than a 
deadly anchor. 

Warlock 

The warlock character class has yet to be depicted in 
the Dragonlance setting. That said, warlocks of various 
types might be individuals who make promises to the 
gods in return for power, and the Undying patron is a 
good match for a character who seeks to follow in the 
footsteps of a long dead but mighty wizard. 

Wizard 

Bladesinging is a good option for elf warriors of the 
Qualinesti or Silvanesti. Like the heroic Gilthanas, a 
bladesinger combines a study of arcane magic with a 
mastery of the blade. 

Eberron 

Use the following guidelines to adapt this book’s class 
options to a campaign set on Eberron. 


Barbarian 


The Purple Dragon Knight is an ideal match for the 
Knights of Solamnia, specifically a Knight of the Rose. 
As leaders of their order, Knights of the Rose are ex- 
pected to provide wisdom, inspiration, and guidance to 
the knights in all situations. 

Monk 

Few monks are found on Krynn, but those active in the 
world fall into two camps. 

The Way of the Long Death provides a good match 
for those evil monks who worship Sargonnas. The mi- 
notaurs who follow Sargas sometimes follow this path, 




The Path of the Battlerager is a great fit for a warforged 
barbarian trained for close quarters battle and with 
a chassis modified to incorporate spikes, blades, and 
other weapons. These warforged made ideal shock 
troops during the Last War. The few that survive have 
little choice but to continue martial pursuits, as their 
frames are suited for little else. 

The new totem warrior options are an obvious choice 
for barbarians with an affinity for a tiger or an elk. The 
option can also reflect an Argonnessen barbarian’s ties 


APPENDIX I CLASS OPTIONS IN OTHER WORLDS

to a specific dragon type. Use the tiger totem for a red 
dragon totem and the elk for a silver dragon totem. 

Cleric 

The Arcana Domain maps to the portfolios overseen by 
Aureon of the Sovereign Host and the Shadow from the 
Dark Six. Blood of Vol cultists who are clerics can also 
take this domain. 

Fighter 

With the Last War in the recent past, the Purple Dragon 
Knight’s role as a combat leader can apply to any fighter 
who served in one of Khorvaire’s militaries as an officer. 
Soldiers from Karrnath, with its strong martial tradi- 
tion, are especially likely to choose this option. 

Monk 

The Way of the Long Death captures the cruel and sinis- 
ter nature of monks devoted to the Mockery. In contrast, 
the Way of the Sun Soul is the perfect option for monks 
dedicated to the Silver Flame, especially those who also 
take levels in the paladin class. 

Paladin 

The Oath of the Crown represents paladins who place 
loyalty to their sovereign ruler above all other concerns. 
The military tradition of Karrnath produces paladins 
who take this oath, especially those whose fanaticism 
leads them to join the Order of the Emerald Claw. 

Rogue _ 

Both the Mastermind and the Swashbuckler are per- 
fectly at home in the city of Sharn. In addition, the ranks 
of the dragonmarked houses are filled with scheming, 
adventurous entrepreneurs best captured by the Master- 
mind’s abilities. 

While the Mastermind lacks a specific ability in inves- 
tigation, pairing it with the right skill selections and abil- 
ity scores (a high Wisdom is a must) yields a good model 
for an inquisitive. 

Sorcerer 

Storm Sorcery is a natural match for House Lyrandar. 
Drawing on the power conferred by that house’s dragon- 
mark, a Lyrandar storm sorcerer can help guide ships 
through the air and across the sea. Such sorcerers are 
likely elite members of the house, since they can guaran- 
tee safe passage through dangerous weather. 

Warlock 

The elves of Aerenal are an ideal match for the Undying. 
Some of these elves enter pacts with their deathless 
ancestors, pledging service and obedience in return for 
ancient secrets of the elves that unlock magical powers, 
as well as mastery over the undead. 

Wizard 

Bladesingers can be found in Aundair, serving as spe- 
cially trained agents of the Arcane Congress. Bladesing- 


ers are specifically tasked with protecting the congress’s 
secrets and ensuring that they never fall into the wrong 
hands. At times, they are dispatched to distant lands 
in search of magic items long thought lost or to deal 
with nascent, magical threats before they grow too 
dangerous. 

Greyhawk 

Use the following guidelines to adapt this book’s class 
options to a campaign set on Oerth. 

Barbarian 

Barbarians are common throughout the northern 
reaches of Oerik. From the lands of the Wolf Nomads 
to the enclaves of the Ice Barbarians, these characters 
venture south in search of loot, glory, and power. Others 
are exiles, forced to leave their homeland under pen- 
alty of death. 

The Path of the Battlerager lacks a direct analog on 
Oerth. Most likely, a battlerager could be of any race 
and formerly trained as a pit fighter by the vicious Slave 
Lords. The Slave Lords are a much-feared cabal who 
direct raids on seaside communities, carrying off pris- 
oners to a wretched life of servitude. A battlerager might 
be one such unfortunate victim. A prisoner who shows 
signs of martial aptitude might be trained in an exotic 
fighting style sure to fetch a high price from a blood- 
thirsty buyer. 

The tiger totem is an easy match for barbarians who 
hail from the realm of the Tiger Nomads. The elk totem 
is most common among the Rovers of the Barrens, pre- 
serving an ancient Flan tradition. 

Cleric 

The Arcana Domain is a perfect match for clerics of 
Boccob. They are charged with using their abilities to 
seek out lost magic items and to help counter the slow 
but relentless disappearance of magic from Oerth. 

Fighter 

The Purple Dragon Knight’s focus on combat leadership 
makes it the ideal model for the Knights of the Watch. 
Charged with protecting the lands of Bissel, Gran 
March, Geoff, and Keoland from Baklunish incursions, 
these knights combine strict discipline, a near-monastic 
way of life, and ample study of battle tactics and strategy 
to remain vigilant against attack. 

Monk 

Monks are relatively rare on Oerth, with the notable ex- 
ception of the sinister Scarlet Brotherhood. 

Among the Scarlet Brotherhood, the Way of the Long 
Death is a secretive technique taught to those who com- 
bine the brotherhood's expertise in unarmed fighting 
with its preference for assassination to remove trouble- 
some enemies. 

The Way of the Sun Soul is a perfect fit for monks 
who worship Pholtus or Pelor. The monastic orders 
among the Baklunish lands could easily yield an order 
of monks dedicated to Al’Akbar. 


APPENDIX I CLASS OPTIONS IN OTHER WORLDS 



Paladin 

The Oath of the Crown can represent a wide variety of 
paladins associated with various knightly orders across 
the Flanaess. The Knights of the Hart are the perfect 
faction for this type of paladin. In addition, paladins as- 
sociated with the Great Kingdom likely take this oath. 

Rogue 

The City of Greyhawk is known as the City of Thieves 
for good reason. Its thieves’ guild exerts power across 
the world. Nestled at the center of the Flanaess’s eco- 
nomic network, the guild and the city it rules has a hand 
in almost every business deal across the region. 

The Mastermind archetype is the perfect way to rep- 
resent an ambitious member of Greyhawk’s thieves’ 
guild. Willing to take a personal risk on a job but more 
comfortable directing muscle, this flavor of rogue is a 
great match for a character who wants to follow in the 
footsteps of Nerof Gasgol and rise to political and eco- 
nomic power. 

Rakes and bravos are common throughout the cities 
of the Flanaess. A Swashbuckler can thus originate 
from almost any city, but among the Rhennee in partic- 
ular, Swashbucklers are common. As travelers along 
waterways, they have learned that a quick, mobile ap- 
proach to combat works best. 

Warlock 

Warlocks are relatively rare in Greyhawk, but as Iuz 
has ascended to power, he has begun to offer power 
directly to those who choose to serve him. Some of the 
other mysterious powers of Oerth, most notably Vecna 
and Tharizdun, also offer pacts to warlocks who dare 
contact them. 

Both Iuz and Vecna fit the Undying patron’s role. Iuz, 
in particular, uses offers of power to corrupt and subvert 
folk among his enemies. He offers easy bargains and 
great power to those in the realms of Furyondy and Ve- 
luna who are willing to subvert those states from within. 
Some warlocks relish their role as turncoats, a few oth- 
ers turn against Iuz, and still others take his power and 
use it to their own ends. 

Wizard 

Bladesingers form an elite cadre of warrior-mages in the 
kingdom of Celene. Some of these agents work beyond 
Celene’s borders, wielding blade and magic against the 
queen’s enemies. The art of the blade song is unknown 
beyond that kingdom; no non-elf has learned its secrets. 

Homemade Worlds 

Running your campaign in a world of your own cre- 
ation? Here are tips for introducing some of this book’s 
character options to your world, skipping options that 
have obvious applications in a world. 

Barbarian 

The Path of the Battlerager is somewhat difficult to 
incorporate into a setting because of its idiosyncratic 
nature. It provides a good match for pit fighters, ber- 


serkers, and gladiators. Its reliance on armor provides a 
good cultural touchstone for dwarf characters, as befits 
its role in the Realms. Alternatively, you could use the 
battlerager as the basis for a militant religious order in 
your world, especially one focused on cruelty or fury. 

For the tiger and elk totems, conversion is simply a 
matter of replacing them with more suitable animals (if 
necessary). 

Cleric 

The concept of a goddess of magic is important to the 
Realms. If your campaign lacks a deity concerned with 
magic, the Arcana Domain works well for religious 
orders charged with hunting down or policing arcane 
spellcasters. If your world strikes a conflict between ar- 
cane and divine magic, this domain provides the divine 
faction’s mage hunters. 

Fighter 

The Purple Dragon Knight captures the essence of a 
bold battlefield strategist. It provides a framework for a 
mercenary captain, a member of an elite order of war- 
riors, or a noble charged with leading vassals into battle. 

Monk 

You've probably noticed that the Way of the Long Death 
and the Way of the Sun Soul are both handy tools for 
modeling monastic orders at opposite ends of the align- 
ment spectrum. A particularly sinister order is a good 
match for the Long Death, while a heroic order follows 
the Way of the Sun Soul. 

Paladin 

The Oath of the Crown's utility for your campaign comes 
from its ability to capture neutral paladins, those whose 
code of conduct is focused on the law rather than on 
moral principles. Its divine spellcasting makes it tricky 
to use as a tool for every knightly order, but it’s a great 
option for a theocracy. You could also decide that the 
spells a paladin casts aren’t divine in origin, but arcane. 

Sorcerer 

Storm Sorcery is a good match for an arcane order sup- 
ported by a powerful seagoing culture. These sorcerers 
might form an elite cadre of sea captains, helping a king- 
dom dominate the sea through trade or raiding. 

Warlock 

The Undying patron is a great option for the agents of a 
powerful lich king, necromancer, or other undead ruler. 
These warlocks are also useful for portraying any cult 
or organization focused on a powerful, undead figure 
from your campaign’s past. 

Wizard 

The bladesingers flavor makes it more than just a war- 
rior/mage in the Forgotten Realms. In your campaign, 
consider using it to model an order of elf knights or an 
elite group of warriors trained to protect the rulers of a 
magocracy.
