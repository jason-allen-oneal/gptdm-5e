Some U n earthed Arcana offeringsdon't end u p resonating with fans and are set aside.The Unearthed Arcana material that inspi red the options i n the following chapters was well received and,thanks to feed back from thousands of D&D fans, hasbeen refined i nto the official forms presented here.TEN RULES TO REMEMBER1. THE DM ADJUDI CATE S T H E RULESThe rules of D&D cover many of the twists andturns that come up in play, but the possibilities areso vast that the rules can't cover everything. Whenyou encounter something that the rules don't coveror if you're unsure how to interpret a rule, the DMdecides how to proceed, aiming for a course thatbrings the most enjoyment to your whole group.2. EXCEPTIONS SUPERSEDE GEN E RAL RULESGeneral rules govern each part of the game. For example, the combat rules tell you that melee weaponattacks use Strength and ranged weapon attacksuse Dexterity. That's a general rule, and a generalrule is in effect as long as something in the gamedoesn't explicitly say otherwise.The game also includes elements-class features,spells, magic items, monster abilities, and the likethat sometimes contradict a general rule. When anexception and a general rule disagree, the exceptionwins. For example, if a feature says you can makemelee weapon attacks using your Charisma, youcan do so, even though that statement disagreeswith the general rule.3. ADVANTAGE AND D I SADVANTAGEEven if more than one factor gives you advantage ordisadvantage on a roll, you have it only once, and ifyou have advantage and disadvantage on the sameroll, they cancel each other.4. REACTION TI M I N GCertain game features let you take a special action,called a reaction, in response to an event. Makingopportunity attacks and casting the shield spell aretwo typical uses of reactions. If you're unsure whena reaction occurs in relation to its trigger, here'sthe rule: the reaction happens after its trigger, unless the description of the reaction explicitly saysotherwise. Once you take a reaction. you can't takeanother one until the start of your next turn.My deAr, 1w;et, l1J.cky reAder,YolJ. k111ow Me. Yo1J.1ve heArd of MY exploih.

PROF I C I ENCY B O N USIf your proficiency bonus applies to a roll, you canadd the bonus only once to the roll , even if multiplethings in the game say your bonus applies. Moreover, if more than one thing tells you to double orhalve your bonus, you double it only once or halveit only once before applying it. Whether multiplied,divided, or left at its normal value, the bonus can beused only once per roll.6. BONUS ACTION S PELLSIf you want to cast a spell that has a casting time of1 bonus action, remember that you can't cast anyother spells before or after it on the same turn, except for cantrips with a casting time of 1 action.7. C ONCENTRATIONAs soon as you start casting a spell or using a special ability that requires concentration, your concentration on another effect ends instantly.8. TEM PORARY HIT POI NTSTemporary hit points aren't cumulative. I f you havetemporary hit points and receive more of them, youdon't add them together, unless a game feature saysyou can. Instead, you decide which temporary hitpoints to keep.9. ROUN D D OW NWhenever you divide o r multiply a number in thegame, round down if you end up with a fraction,even if the fraction is one-half or greater.IQ; H AVE FUNYou don't need to know every rule to enjoy D&D,and each group has its own style-different ways itlikes to tell stories and to use the rules. Embracewhat your group enjoys most. In short, followyour bliss!US I N G T H I S BOOK 5C HAPTER 1CHARACTER OPTIONSHEN YOU MAKE YOUR D&D CHARACTER,you have an array of options in thePlayer's Handbook to create the sort ofadventurer you want. This chapter addsto those options, making it possible to realize evenmore character concepts. If you combine these options with those in Xanathar's Guide to Everything,the possibilities for your characters become vast.Here are the options featured in this chapter:• A way to customize your character's origin bychanging some of your racial traits• Guidance on changing your subclass• The artificer class, a master of magical invention• Class features and subclasses for every class inthe Player's Handbook• Feats for anyone who uses that optional ruleC U STOM I Z I N G YOU R O RI GI NAt 1 st level, you choose various aspects of yourcharacter, including ability scores, race, class, andbackground. Together these elements help paint apicture of your character's origin and give you theability to create many different types of characters.Despite that versatility, a typical character race inD&D includes little or no choice-a lack that canmake it difficult to realize certain character concepts. The following subsections address that lackby adding choice to your character's race, allowingyou to customize your ability scores, languages,and certain proficiencies to fit the origin you havein mind for your character. Character race in thegame represents your character's fantasy species,combined with certain cultural assumptions. Thefollowing options step outside those assumptions topave the way for truly unique characters.ABILITY SCORE INCREASESWhatever D&D race you choose for your character,you get a trait called Ability Score Increase. Thisincrease reflects an archetypal bit of excellence inthe adventurers of this kind in D&D's past. For example, if you're a dwarf, your Constitution increasesby 2, because dwarf heroes in D&D are often exceptionally tough. This increase doesn't apply to everydwarf, just to dwarf adventurers, and it exists toreinforce an archetype. That reinforcement is appropriate if you want to lean into the archetype, but it'sunhelpful if your character doesn't conform to thearchetype.If you'd like your character to follow their ownpath, you may ignore your Ability Score Increasetrait and assign ability score increases tailored toyour character. Here's how to do it: take any abilityscore increase you gain in your race or subraceand apply it to an ability score of your choice. If yougain more than one increase, you can't apply thoseincreases to the same ability score, and you can'tincrease a score above 20.For example, if the Ability Score Increase trait ofyour race or subrace increases your Constitution by2 and your Wisdom by 1 , you could instead increaseyour Intelligence by 2 and your Charisma by 1 .LANGUAGESYour character's race includes languages that yourcharacter is assumed to know, usually Commonand the language of your ancestors. For example, ahalfling adventurer is assumed to know Commonand Halfling. Here's the thing: D&D adventurers areextraordinary, and your character might have grownup speaking languages different from the ones inyour Languages trait.To customize the languages you know, you mayreplace each language in your Languages trait witha language from the following list: Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Deep Speech, Draconic, Dwarvish,Elvish, Giant, Gnomish, Goblin, Halfling, Infernal,Ore, Primordial, Sylvan, or Undercommon.Your DM may add or remove languages from thatlist, depending on what languages are appropriatefor your campaign.PROFICIENCIESSome races and subraces grant proficiencies. Theseproficiencies are usually cultural, and your character might not have any connection with the culturein question or might have pursued different training.You can replace each of those proficiencies with adifferent one of your choice, following the restrictions on the Proficiency Swaps table.PROFI C I E N C Y SWA P SProficiencyS k i l lArmorS i m p l e weaponM artial weaponToolReplacement ProficiencySkillS i m ple/martial wea pon or toolS i m p l e weapon or toolS i m ple/martial weapon or toolTool or simple weaponC H A PT E R 1 I C H A R AC T E R OPTIONSCUSTOM L I N E A CEI nstead of choosing one of the game's races for you rcharacter a t 1 st level, you c a n u s e t h e fol lowing traitsto represent you r character's l i neage, givi ng you fu l lcontrol over how you r character's origin shaped them:Creature Type. You· are a h umanoid. You determ ineyou r a p pearance a n d whether you resemble a nyof your kin.Size. You are Small or Medium (your choice).Speed. You r base walking speed is 30 feet.Ability Score Increase. One ability score of you r choiceincreases by 2.Feat. You gain one feat of you r choice for whichyou qualify.Variable Trait. You gain one of the following options ofyou r choice: (a) d arkvis ion with a range of 60 feet or(b) proficiency in one s ki l l of you r choice.Languages. You can s peak, read, and write Com monand one other language that you and you r D M agreeis appropriate for you r character.For example, high elf adventurers have proficiencywith longswords, which are martial weapons. Consulting the Proficiency Swaps table, we see thatyour high elf can swap that proficiency for proficiency with another weapon or a tool. Your elf mightbe a musician, who chooses proficiency with amusical instrument-a type of tool-instead of withlongswords. Similarly, elves start with proficiencyin the Perception skill. Your elf might not have thekeen senses associated with your kin and could takeproficiency in a different skill, such as Performance.The "Equipment" chapter of the Player's Handbook includes weapons and tools suitable for theseswaps, and your DM might allow additional options.PERS ONALITYThe description of a race might suggest variousthings about the behavior and personality of thatpeople's archetypal adventurers. You may ignorethose suggestions, whether they're about alignment,moods, interests, or any other personality trait. Yourcharacter's personality and behavior are entirelyyours to determine.C HA NGI NG A S K I LLSometimes you pick a skill proficiency that ends upnot being very useful in the campaign or that no longer fits your character's story. In those cases, talk toyour DM about replacing that skill proficiency withanother skill proficiency offered by your class at 1stlevel. A convenient time for such a change is whenyou reach a level that grants you the Ability ScoreIncrease feature, representing that your characterhas spent a level or two studying the new skill andletting the old one atrophy.8 C H A PT E R I I C H A R ACTER O P T I O N SC HA NGING YOU R SUB C LA S SEach character class involves the choice of a subclass at 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level. A subclass representsan area of specialization and offers different classfeatures as you level up. With your DM's approval,you can change your subclass when you would normally gain a new subclass feature. If you decide tomake this change, choose another subclass that belongs to your class and replace all your old subclassfeatures with the features of the new subclass thatare for your new level and lower.TRAINING TIMETo change your subclass, your DM might requireyou to spend time devoted to the transition, asyou study the ways of the new specialization. Thistransition requires a number of days equal to twiceyour new level in the class; a higher level representsmore to learn.The DM might also require an expenditure ofmoney to pay for training, magical reagents, or othergoods needed for the transition. The cost is typically100 gp times your new level. This cost might beaccompanied by a quest of some sort. For example,a sorcerer who wants to adopt a Draconic Bloodlinecould be required to receive blood, a blessing, orboth from an ancient dragon.If you return to a subclass that you previouslyheld, you forgo the gold cost, and the time requiredfor the transition is halved.SUDDEN CHANGESometimes a character undergoes a dramatictransformation in their beliefs and abilities. Whena character experiences a profound self-realizationor faces an entity or a place of overwhelming power,beauty, or terror, the DM might allow an immediatesubclass change. Here are a few examples:• An Oath of Devotion paladin failed to stop a demonic horde from ravaging her homeland. Afterspending a night in sorrowful prayer, she rises thenext morning with the features of the Oath of Vengeance, ready to hunt down the horde.• A wizard lies down for a nap beneath an oak treewhose roots reach into the Feywild. In his dreams,he faces visions of multiple possible futures. When· he awakens, his subclass features have been replaced by those of the School of Divination.• A cleric of the War Domain has spent years inconflict with the enemies of her temple. But oneday, she wanders into a sun-dappled glade, whereher god once shed a tear of mercy over the world'ssuffering. Drinking from the glade's brook, thecleric is filled with such compassion for all peoplethat she now bears the powers of the Life Domain,ready to heal rather than make war.IARTIFICERMasters of invention, artificers use ingenuity andmagic to unlock extraordinary capabilities in objects. They see magic as a complex system waitingto be decoded and then harnessed in their spellsand inventions. You can find everything you need toplay one of these inventors in the next few sections.Artificers use a variety of tools to channel theirarcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might usealchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic ofartificers is tied to their tools and their talents, andfew other characters can produce the right tool for ajob as well as an artificer.ARTIFICERS IN MANY WORLDSThroughout the D&D multiverse, artificers createinventions and magic items of peace and war. Manylives have been brightened or saved because of thework of kind artificers, but countless lives havealso been lost because of the mass destruction unleashed by certain artificers' creations.In the Forgotten Realms, the island of Lantan ishome to many artificers, and in the world of Dragonlance, tinker gnomes are often members of thisclass. The strange technologies in the Barrier Peaksof the world of Greyhawk have inspired some folkto walk the path of the artificer, and in Mystara, various nations employ artificers to keep airships andother wondrous devices operational.Artificers in the City of Sigil share discoveriesfrom throughout the multiverse, and from there,the gnome artificer Vi runs a cosmos-spanningbusiness that hires adventurers to fix problems thatothers deem unfixable. In Vi's home world, Eberron,magic is harnessed as a form of science and deployed throughout society, largely as a result of thewondrous ingenuity of artificers.CREATING AN ARTIFICERArtipcen i�ve�t ci.tfti� �-e��e probleM�, the� try to�olve theM-lolA�ly A�� ofte� with collAterAI �AMA�e.TASHATo create an artificer, consult the following subsections, which give you hit points, proficiencies, andstarting equipment.

Add half you r levels (rounded u p) i nthe a rtificer class to the appro priate levels from otherclasses to determine you r available spell slots.C LA S S FEATUR E SAs an artificer, you gain the following class features,which are summarized in the Artificer table.MAGICAL TINKERING1st-level artificer featureYou've learned how to invest a spark of magic intomundane objects. To use this ability, you must havethieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand. You thentouch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action andgive it one of the following magical properties ofyour choice:• The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius anddim light for an additional 5 feet.• Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits arecorded message that can be heard up to 10 feetaway. You utter the message when you bestow thisproperty on the object, and the recording can beno more than 6 seconds long.• The object continuously emits your choice of anodor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping,or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.• A static visual effect appears on one of the object'ssurfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture ofthese elements, as you like.The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As anaction, you can touch the object and end the property early.You can bestow magic on multiple objects,touching one object each time you use this feature,though a single object can only bear one propertyat a time. The maximum number of objects youcan affect with this feature at one time is equal toyour Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldestproperty immediately ends, and then the new property applies.SPELLCASTING1st-level artificer featureYou've studied the workings of magic and how tocast spells, channeling the magic through objects.To observers, you don't appear to be casting spellsin a conventional way; you appear to producewonders from mundane items and outlandishinventions.·TOOLS R EQUI R E DYou produce your artificer spell effects through yourtools. You must have a spellcasting focus-specifically thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool-inhand when you cast any spell with this Spellcastingfeature (meaning the spell has an "M" componentTH E MACI C OF A R TI FI CEAs an artificer, you use tools when you cast yourspells. When describing your s pellcasting, think a bouthow you're using a tool. For example, if you cast curewounds using a lchemist's s u pplies , you coul d beq uickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tin ker'stools, you m ight have a m i niature mechan ical spiderthat binds wou nds. The effect of the spell is the sameeither way.Such details don't l i m it you in any way or provide youwith any benefit beyond the spell's effects. You don'th ave to j ustify how you 're using tool s to cast a s pell.B ut describing your spel lcasting creatively is a fu n wayto d istinguish yourself from other s pellcasters.when you cast it). You must be proficient with thetool to use it in this way. See the equipment chapter in the Player's Handbook for descriptions ofthese tools.After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level,you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.CANTRIPS (0-LEVEL SPELL S)You know two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list. At higher levels, you learn additionalartificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in theCantrips Known column of the Artificer table.When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know withanother cantrip from the artificer spell list.P R E PA R I NG A N D CASTING SPELLSThe Artificer table shows how many spell slots youhave to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of yourartificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regainall expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.You prepare the list of artificer spells that areavailable for you to cast, choosing from the artificerspell list. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + halfyour artificer level, rounded down (minimum of onespell). The spells must be of a level for which youhave spell slots.For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, youhave four 1 st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots.With an Intelligence of 14, your list of preparedspells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, inany combination. If you prepare the 1 st-level spellcure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove itfrom your list of prepared spells.You can change your list of prepared spells whenyou finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with yourspellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell levelfor each spell on your list.C H AP T E R I I C H A RACTER OPTIONSSPELLCASTING ABILITYIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behindmagic allows you to wield these spells with superiorskill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificerspell refers to your spellcasting ability.

These patronsprovide a strong binding element: an individual oran organization that unites a party as a team in service to a greater purpose. A group patron can helpset the tone of your party's entire campaign. Forexample, a group whose patron is an academic institution is likely to have a very different story from agroup that serves a military. A patron can influencecharacters' relationships, their backstories, and thetypes of dangers they face.During character creation, every player has theopportunity to weave connections between theircharacter and the other members of their party.Rather than (or in addition to) creating a web of established relationships, players can work with theDM to choose a group patron. And if you're interested in being your own patron, see the "Being YourOwn Patron" section at the end of the chapter.How PATRONS WOR KThe following sections present several group patronoptions. The description of each patron providesan overview of the types of organizations the grouppatron represents, perks of membership, and queststhe patron encourages adventurers to undertake.With the input of your DM, you can customizethese patrons to reflect specific establishments inyour campaign world or to serve as a launchpadtailored for organizations of your design. For example, the guild group patron could represent theHarpers or the Zhentarim of the Forgotten Realms,the Clifftop Adventurers' Guild in Eberron, or ahomebrew league of caravan guards. Or perhaps acriminal syndicate, military force, or other categoryof patron better fits the party's goals. Choose andcustomize the group patron that works best foryour party and the types of adventures you wantto explore.GROU P A s s i sTANCEHaving a group patron gives an adventuring groupa common purpose, which inspires better coordination in the form of guidance and encouragement. Asa result of this unity, each member of the party cangrant advantage to an ability check, an attack roll, ora saving th row of another member of the party. Togrant advantage in this way, a character and the chosen target must be able to see or hear each other,and neither can be incapacitated. Once a partymember grants this advantage, that individual can'tdo so again until they finish a long rest.PERKSA group patron offers your party a number of perksfor your service. These range from standard business arrangements, such as a steady wage and access to staff facilities, to extraordinary boons, suchas audiences with powerful figures or exceptionsfrom certain laws. Specific perks are presented inthe description of each group patron.The DM should not feel limited to providing onlythe perks noted in each group patron's description.Patrons give a party access to solutions and supportthey wouldn't have otherwise, and a patron can usetheir varied resources to guide their agents or prepare them for greater adventures.ASSIGNMENTSYour group's patron occasionally offers you an assignment, a mission that provides a springboard foradventure. Of course, it's up to you how you respondto your patron's demands, and interesting storiescan result if you decide to refuse an assignment.A more hands-off patron can still significantlymotivate your group. Maybe you seek adventuresbased on what pleases your patron, possibly earningstatus and rewards within your organization. Anacademy, for example, might not organize particularmissions, so you hunt down ancient artifacts knowing that your patron will reward you for bringingthem back. You have the freedom to chart your owndestiny, while letting the patron shape the nature ofyour group and the adventures you undertake.EXAM PLE PATRONSHere are some of the most likely patrons fo r a n adventuring group.

As operatives for an academy,you seek to unravel the secrets of existence and thedeeper riddles beyond.In your work, you brush shoulders with the wisestin the land, travel to places spoken of in myth, anddiscover truths beyond imagining. Denying ignorance, you pursue wondrous sights and endlesslyunearth new facts. Undiscovered creatures, the covetous dead, and jealous rivals impede your work, butin the pursuit of knowledge, no risk is too great.TYPES OF ACADEMIESAny assemblage o f scholars and truth-seekers canfunction as an academy. Generally, an academyunites a network of learned individuals, allowingthem to share their knowledge, further their research, and support common goals. Passing on wisdom to the next generation is part of an academy'smandate, but members find opportunities to undertake far-flung research expeditions-only so muchcan be learned in libraries, after all. An academy'sfocus can be broad or singular, artistic or scientific,mundane or magical. For every topic with unexplored possibilities, an academy seeks to plumb itsdepths or elevate its study.Roll or pick from the Academy Type table to determine the institution with which you're aligned.ACA D E M Y TYP Ed 6 Academy TypesBoarding School.

The academy pays for the workyou do on its behalf. The nature of your employmentinfluences your compensation. On average, theacademy pays each member of your group 1 gp perday, or enough to sustain a modest lifestyle. Alternatively, you receive a bounty (at least 250 gp) for eachartifact or relevant discovery you bring back fromyour adventures and donate to the academy.Documentation. Each member of your group hasidentification denoting your affiliation with the academy. This association carries clout in scholarly orartistic circles. The academy also secures documentation, letters of introduction, and traveling papersif your work requires them. Such documents grantyou special status, such as access to forbidden regions or neutral standing in embattled areas. Suchidentification isn't always a boon, though. In a landfrequently plundered by foreigners, your documentscould mark you as nothing more than aggrandizedlooters to some.Research. Research is part of your group's job,but your patron also has abundant resources tofacilitate such efforts. You can call in a favor todelegate the work of researching lore (a downtimeactivity described in the Player's Handbook andXanathar's Guide to Everything) to a colleague,contact, librarian, or research assistant. You're responsible for covering expenses incurred as part ofthis research, and the DM determines its successor failure.Resources. Academies host libraries, museums,record repositories, and training facilities, and youcan use them to further your work. You can call in afavor from faculty members to access resources notavailable to the public-dangerous relics or magicitems, spellbooks, gear, and the like. Additionally,you can consult with the faculty of your academy asthe experts in various fields.Training. Because you're associated with theacademy, you receive a discount on any educationyou wish to pursue. When you undergo training asa downtime activity (as described in the Player'sHandbook or Xanathar's Guide to Everything), youpay half the normal cost, assuming the academyteaches that subject. Training in languages, musicalinstruments, and other tools is also available, atthe DM's discretion. In addition, you can gain proficiency in the Arcana, History, Nature, or Religionskills by this method, as if you were learning a language. A character can learn only one of these skillsin this way.ACADEMY C ONTACTHow much autonomy you have in choosing yourmissions and how often you're expected to performon the academy's behalf depends largely on yourplace in the institution's hierarchy. As students, newprofessors, or support staff, you aid the work of asenior professor or entire department. If you are further along in your career, you have your own goalsand assistants, but you still take on assignments tofurther the goals of esteemed experts, deans, or theacademy as a whole.

Consider being a promising student or a new member of the faculty. While you havea modest course load that you handle behind thescenes (or using any of a variety of downtime activities), your primary interests involve aiding your contact in their research. Alternatively, you might workto further the academy's efforts in another way, perhaps related to security or funding.The Academy Factotum Roles table providessuggestions for functions you perform within anacademy and the backgrounds frequently associatedwith each role.C H A PT E R 2 I GROU P PAT RONS 8 5ACAD E M Y FACTOTU M ROLESRole BackgroundsStudent Acolyte, G u ild Artisan, Noble,Outlander, Sage, U rc h i nG roundskeeper .

Academicsstruggle to keep one step ahead of their scholarlyrivals, making many of them suspicious of-evenhostile toward-other intellectuals. Beyond rivalswithin their own profession, academics face challenges from their subjects (whether members oflost civilizations or magical beings) or suspiciousanti-intellectuals.

While in service to the sovereign,you have access to the highest echelons of society.With your patron's permission, you can gain accessto the halls of power, from national capitols andmilitary headquarters to noble estates and trovesof state secrets. You can also request that the sovereign grant you access to perks of their position,like access to diplomatic receptions or use of theroyal guards.Expenses. Your patron reimburses you for extraordinary expenses incurred as part of your work.You are required to account for your expenses andmust explain any extraordinary expenditures, butroutine travel, ordinary equipment, and basic services don't draw a second glance.Immunity. As Jong as you remain in the sovereign's good graces, you are nearly immune toprosecution under the laws within their sphere ofinfluence. When you are carrying out your orders,you have a great deal of leeway in how you choose togo about that, and the Jaw isn't an obstacle. Committing serious crimes-especially if they are unrelatedor unnecessary for the assigned work-is a sure wayto fall out of your patron's good graces, however.Salary. Your employment under a sovereign patron brings an income of 1 gp per day, or enough tomaintain a modest lifestyle. At the DM's discretion,your salary increases or decreases depending onthe sovereign's nature, the type of work you perform, and the length of your employment.C H A P T E R 2 I GROUP PATRONS I O ISOVEREIGN C ONTACTYou might benefit from direct contact with yourgroup patron. This includes audiences or secretmeetings with the sovereign, depending on the nature of your work. Alternatively, the sovereign mightpurposefully wantto keep their distance from you,either due to their busy schedules or to maintainplausible deniability regarding your work. In suchcases, an advisor or functionary oversees your assignments, serving as the primary contact betweenyou and the sovereign.Roll or pick from the Sovereign Contact table todetermine who manages the relationship betweenyou and the throne, if not the sovereign directly.SOVE R E I G N CO N TACTd6 ContactIntimate Confidant.

A semi-retired, leisure-loving ambassadorspeaks in suggestion and innuendo.6 Spectral Assembly. A ghostly council of the nation'sprevious regents manifests to avert disasters.SOVEREIGN PROXIESYou serve a sovereign out of national pride, out oftradition, or for your own practical reasons. Theneeds of a leader potentially embroil you directly inpolitical intrigues, court maneuverings, or threatsfrom national foes. It's up to you and the sovereignto determine whether your work is publicly acknowledged or top secret-and if the latter, what happensif your work is exposed.The Sovereign Proxy Roles table suggests waysyou might serve a sovereign and the backgroundsfrequently associated with each role.1 0 2 C H A PT E R 2 I G ROU P PATRONSSOV E R E I G N PROXY ROLESRoleAdvisorAmbassadorSecret AgentChampionjesterBackgroundsAcolyte, Folk Hero, Noble, Sage,SoldierCharlatan, Folk Hero, Guild Artisan,Noble, SailorCharlatan, Criminal, Entertainer,Soldier, UrchinCriminal, Noble, Outlander, Soldier,UrchinCharlatan, Criminal, Entertainer,Outlander, U rchinConfidant AnySOVEREIGN QUESTSThe services you provide a sovereign largely dependon the nature of your group patron and their nation.While some of your missions involve official tasksmissions undertaken in the sovereign's name-others might be covert, making your patron's identity ahighly guarded secret. Political rivals, enemy countries, and natural disasters all pose dangers to thesovereign's nation. Yet a sovereign who sows chaos,enacts tyrannical decrees, or jeopardizes a population's way of life is likely to inspire rebellions.

You prepare the sovereign's heir for thechallenge of taking the throne.6 Desperate Diplomacy. You seek to make peace witha force or entity that could wipe out your nation.B E ING YOU R OWN PATRONFor some players, the idea of running a crime syndicate, mercenary company, arcane scholars' collective, or other organization is far more exciting thanworking for someone else. Founding your own organization offers a greater degree of autonomy, thoughpotentially at the cost of support and reliable work.When you're the boss, the perks of belonging toan organization become expenses you have to worryabout; when you run your own mercenary company,for example, you need to stock your own armory,rather than drawing on an existing organization'sstockpile. The organization brings in income,but you'll have to spend it to keep the organiza-tion running.When you run your own organization, use theRunning a Business downtime activity (described inthe Dungeon Master's Guide) to reflect your organization's ongoing activities. More than one charactercan take part in this activity at a time.

If the business earns a profit, multiply that profit by 4 + the number of characters whotook part in this downtime activity.Don't discount the value of adopting an NPC toserve as your contact within your own organization.A secretary, majordomo, or apprentice keeps upwith your group's bureaucracy while you're conducting missions and passes along information thatcould lead to your next adventure!C H A PT E R 2 I GROUP PAT RONS 1 03...C HAPTER 3MAGICAL MIS CELLANYAGIC IS EVERYWHERE IN D&D.

You andyour friends may even have created some homemadeD&D worlds yourselves!It was not always so. Various scholars speak of a primordial state, a single real ity they call the First World,which preceded the multiverse as we know it. Manyof the peoples and monsters that i nhabit the worldsin the Material Plane originated there. After the FirstWorld was shattered by a great cataclysm-givingbirth to the worlds that came in its wake-the progenyof the first elves, dwarves, beholders, and other iconiccreatures took root on world after world, like seedsscattered by a cosmic wind. If the musings of thesegreat sages are true, every world is a reflection-andin some cases, a distortion-of the First World.Transit between these worlds is rare but not impossible and can be accomplished in various ways.One such method is called the Great Journey, an epicvoyage fraught with peril and littered with obstacles tobe overcome. This journey most often occurs aboard avessel powered by magic.Another method is the Dream of Other Worlds; travelers fal l into a deep slumber and dream themselvesinto a new realm. The spell dream ofthe blue veil employs this method of transit.The most direct method is the Leap to AnotherRealm; a spellcaster casts teleportation circle or teleport, aiming to appear in a known teleportation circleor some other location in another world.Whatever method you use to reach a world, the OMdetermines whether you succeed and where exactlyyou appear if you do arrive in that realm.You and up to eight willing creatures within rangefall unconscious for the spell's duration and experience visions of another world on the Material Plane,such as Oerth, Tori!, Krynn, or Eberron. If the spellreaches its full duration, the visions conclude witheach of you encountering and pulling back a mysterious blue curtain. The spell then ends with youmentally and physically transported to the worldthat was in the visions.To cast this spell, you must have a magic item thatoriginated on the world you wish to reach, and youmust be aware of the world's existence, even if youdon't know the world's name. Your destination in theother world is a safe location within 1 mile of wherethe magic item was created. Alternatively, you cancast the spell if one of the affected creatures wasborn on the other world, which causes your destination to be a safe location within 1 mile of where thatcreature was born.The spell ends early on a creature if that creaturetakes any damage, and the creature isn't transported. If you take any damage, the spell ends foryou and all the other creatures, with none of youbeing transported.GREEN-FLAME BLADEEvocation cantripCasting Time: 1 actionRange: Self (5-foot radius)Components: S, M (a melee weapon worth atleast 1 sp) ·Duration: InstantaneousYou brandish the weapon used in the spell's castingand make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you.

The second creature takes fire damageequal to your spellcasting ability modifier.This spell's damage increases when you reachcertain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals anextra 1d8 fire damage to the target on a hit, and thefire damage to the second creature increases to 1d8+ your spellcasting ability modifier.

Perhaps you wish the effects ofyour caster's spells to appear in their favorite color,to suggest the training they received from a celestialmentor, or to exhibit their connection to a seasonof the year. The possibilities for how you mightcosmetically customize your character's spells areendless. However, such alterations can't change theeffects of a spell. They also can't make one spellseem like another-you can't, for example, make amagic missile look like a fireball.When customizing your spellcaster's magic, consider developing a theme-often, the broader andmore versatile the better. You may describe yourcaster's magic whenever you wish, particularlywhen it makes an interesting addition to a story.You may also use it to reinforce other choices you'vemade for your character, like making a bard's spellstied more closely to their favored art form or a cleric's spells themed around their deity.For example, the fireball of a wizard with afondness for storms might erupt to look like burning clouds or a burst of red lightning (withoutaffecting the spell's damage type), while the samewizard's haste spell might limn the target in faintthunderheads.Alternatively, a cleric who serves a moon godmight radiate faint moonlight around their handswhen they cast cure wounds, or their shield offaithmight surround the target with glimmering crescent moons.Further still, a druid could choose a cherryblossom theme for their magic, causing delicatebranches and pink leaves to grow when they cast entangle or shillelagh, and their faerie fire spell couldappear more like wind-tossed petals than flames.The Magic Themes table offers just a few suggestions that might inspire you while personalizingyour character's spells.MAG I C TH E M ESdlO ThemeBook pages, origami, quills, and ink, all accompanied by rustling sounds and library scents2 Brine-scented shapes of sharks, jellyfish, octopi,and other sea creatures3 Food or utensils that carry the scent of cuisinefrom the spellcaster's homeland4 Rich, copper scents accom panied by what appears to be the caster's own imbalanced humors5 Bursts and strokes of watercolor painted by aninvisible brush6 Transparent weapons, armor, miniature war machines, and phantom soldiers7 Golden rays that carry faint warmth and the hintof windblown sand8 Rowdy barnyard animals accompanied by thewarm scents of coops and stables9 Manifestations of deep emotions, like the faintshackles of melancholy, sepia shades of nostalgia,or heart-shaped bursts of affection� 1 0 Tiny whimsical o r fearsome beings from the spell-;:;� caster's inescapable, recurring dreamsIuI�<(I0;;;MAGIC ITE M S•• IWho doe1r.'t love MA,ic iteMI?

The servant containsenough space for 1 ton of cargo and a crew compartment within, from which up to two Medium creatures can control it-and potentially execute a spreeof unstoppable destruction.Tales of the servant's origins involve more conjecture than fact, often referring to otherworldly beings, the mysterious Barrier Peaks in Oerth, and thesupposedly related device known as the Machineof Lum the Mad. The best details on the device'sorigins and operation can be found in the Mind ofMetal, a tome of artificer's secrets that connects thedevice to the traditions of the lost Olman people,and which was written by Lum the Mad's severaltimes over granddaughter, Lum the Maestro, whileshe reconstructed the long disassembled MightyServant of Leuk-o.Dangerous Attunement.

By inputting a specific series oflever pulls and button presses, the servant's twocrew members can cause it to explode. The self-destruct code is not revealed to crew members whenthey attune to the artifact. If the code is discovered(the DM determines how), it requires two attunedcrew members to be inside the servant and spendtheir actions on 3 consecutive rounds performingthe command. Should the crew members begin theprocess of entering the code, though, the servantuses its Ghost in the Machine property and turnsthe crew members against each other.If the crew members successfully implement thecode, at the end of the third round, the servant explodes. Every creature in a 1 00-foot-radius spherecentered on the servant must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw.

As a DM, your tools includeyour imagination, your ability to discernwhat entertains your players, your storytelling acumen, your sense of humor, your ability to listen well,your facility with the game's rules, and more. Thischapter adds to your toolbox with guidance and optional rules for a variety of situations. The chapteralso includes a selection of ready-to-use puzzles,which you can drop into any campaign.The tools herein build on the material in theDungeon Master's Guide and the Monster Manual.You may use some, all, or none of these tools, andfeel free to customize how they work. Your group'senjoyment is paramount, so make these rules yourown, aiming to match your group's tastes.S E S SION Z E ROE1t/.\bli1h bo1.u-\ti/.\rie1. Ariii if /.\Vl�orie cro\\e\ theM, lpe/.\kup. If the� iiori't lilteri, there'\ /.\IW/.\�I douiikill ... ...TA�llABefore making characters or playing the game, theDM and players can run a special session-colloquially called session zero-to establish expectations,outline the terms of a social contract, and sharehouse rules. Making and sticking to these rules canhelp ensure that the game is a fun experience foreveryone involved.Often a session zero includes building characterstogether. As the DM, you can help players duringthe character creation process by advising them toselect options that will serve the adventure or campaign that awaits.CHARACTER AND PARTY CREATIONEach player has options when it comes to choosinga character race, class, and background, though youmay restrict certain options that are deemed unsuitable for the campaign. If there are multiple playersin the group, yo� should encourage them to choosedifferent classes so that the adventuring party hasa range of abilities. It's less important that the partyinclude multiple backgrounds, as sometimes it'sfun to play an all-soldier party or a troupe of adventuring entertainers. The backgrounds they choosedefine who their characters were before becomingadventurers and also include roleplaying hooks inthe form of ideals, bonds, and flaws-things youought to know. For example, if a player choosesthe criminal background, one of the options for thecharacter's bond is, "I'm trying to pay off an old debtI owe to a generous benefactor." If that's the character's bond, you should work with the player to decidewho that generous benefactor is and build relevantstorylines into the larger campaign.PARTY FORMATIONDuring session zero, your role is to let the playersbuild the characters they want and to help themcome up with explanations for how their characters came together to form an adventuring party. Itcan be helpful to assume that the characters knoweach other and have some sort of history together,however brief that history might be. Here are somequestions you can ask the players as they createcharacters to get a sense of the party's relationships:• Are any of the characters related to each other?• What keeps the characters together as a party?• What does each character like most about everyother member of the adventuring party?• Does the group have a patron? See chapter 2,"Group Patrons," for patron examples.If the players are having trouble coming up with astory for how their characters met, they may choosean option from the Party Origin table or let a d6 rollchoose it for them. You should spend part of sessionzero helping the players flesh out the details. For example, if the characters came together to overcomea common foe, the identity of this enemy needs tobe determined. If a funeral gathered the group, theidentity of the deceased and each character's relationship to them will need to be fleshed out.PARTY O R I G I Nd6 Origin StoryThe characters grew u p i n the same p lace a n d haveknow n each other fo r years.2 The characters have u nited to overcome a foe.3 The characters were b ro ught together by a commonbenefactor who wishes to sponsor their adventu res.4 A funeral bri ngs the characters together.5 A festival bri n gs the characters together.6 The characters fi n d themselves trapped together.C H A PT E R 4 I D U N G E O N M ASTE R' S TOOLS 1 3 91 4 0RUNNING A GAM E FOR ONE PLAYERA DM running a game for one player should spendpart of session zero working with that player tocome up with their character's backstory, thenlet the player decide if they want the character tohave a sidekick (see the "Sidekicks" section inthis chapter).You might need to help the player run the sidekickfor the first few sessions and should make sure theplayer understands the functions and limitations ofsidekicks:• Sidekicks are stalwart companions who can perform tasks both in and out of combat, includingthings such as setting up camp and carrying gear.• Ideally, a sidekick's abilities should complement those of the main character. For example, a spellcaster makes a good sidekick for afighter or rogue.C H A PT E R 4 I D U N G E O N M A STE R ' S TOOLSSOCIAL CONTRACTD&D is first and foremost meant to be a fun-for-allexperience. If one or more participants aren't having fun, the game won't last long. Session zero isthe perfect time for you and the players to discussthe experience they're hoping for, as well as topics,themes, and behavior they deem inappropriate. Outof this discussion, a social contract begins to form.Sometimes a social contract takes shape organically, but it's good practice to have a direct conversation during session zero to establish boundariesand expectations. A typical social contract in a D&Dgroup includes implicit or explicit commitments tothe following points:• You will respect the players by running a gamethat is fun, fair, and tailored for them. You will allow every player to contribute to the ongoing storyand give every character moments to shine. Whena player is talking, you are listening.• The players will respect you and the effort it takesto create a fun game for everyone. The players willallow you to direct the campaign, arbitrate therules, and settle arguments. When you are talking,the players are listening.• The players will respect one another, listen to oneanother, support one another, and do their utmostto preserve the cohesion of the adventuring party.• Should you or a player disrespect each other orviolate the social contract in some other way, thegroup may dismiss that person from the table.This social contract covers the basics, but indi-vidual groups might require additional agreed-uponterms to guarantee a fun play experience for all. Anda social contract typically evolves as a group's members learn more about one another.HARD AND SOFT LIMITSOnce you and the players have acknowledged theterms of the game's social contract and agreed touphold them, the conversation can segue into a discussion about soft and hard limits. There are manyways to mediate this discussion, and you might wantto do some research to find an approach that mightwork well for your group. For purposes of this explanation, these terms are described as follows:A soft limit is a threshold that one should thinktwice about crossing, as it is likely to create genuine anxiety, fear, and discomfort.A hard limit is a threshold that should neverbe crossed.Every member of the group has soft and hard limits, and it behooves everyone in the group to knowwhat they are. Make sure everyone at the table iscomfortable with how this discussion takes place.Players might not want to discuss their limits aloudaround the table, especially if they're new to roleplaying games or haven't spent a lot of time withcertain other members of the group. One way toalleviate such discomfort is to encourage the playersto share their limits privately with you and allowyou to present them without attribution to the wholegroup. For example, the players could write theirlimits on index cards for you to read aloud. Howeverthese limits are presented, it would be useful for youor one of the players to compile the limits into onelist that can be shared with the whole group. Keepin mind that any discussion about limits should betreated with care-even sharing a person's limitscan be a very painful experience, and this conversation should be handled with respect.Common in-game limits include-but are not limited to-themes or scenes of sex, exploitation, racialprofiling, slavery, violence toward children and animals, gratuitous swearing, and intra-party romance.Common out-of-game limits include unwanted physical contact, dice-sharing, dice-throwing, shouting,vulgarity, rules lawyering, distracting use of cellphones, and generally disrespectful behavior.The discussion of limits is important becauseDMs and players can have phobias or triggers thatothers might not be aware of. Any in-game topic ortheme that makes a member of the gaming groupfeel unsafe or uncomfortable should be avoided. If atopic or theme makes one or more players nervousbut they give you consent to include it in-game, incorporating it should be handled with care, and youmust be ready to veer away from such topics andthemes quickly.While session zero is the perfect place to start thisdiscussion, it might not be the only time limits areaddressed. Someone might cross a line and need tobe reminded of a limit, or someone might not thinkto include some of their limits in the initial discussion. Players can also discover new limits as thecampaign unfolds. Make a plan to check in with thegroup to make sure the list of hard and soft limitsis up to date, and remind everyone to revisit this listoften in case it changes.GAME CUSTOMIZATIONIn addition to shaping the game around the characters in the adventuring party, you should beprepared to customize the game to suit the players'tastes. The "Know Your Players" section in the introduction of the Dungeon Master's Guide providessome guidance for doing so, based on known playerarchetypes. To help identity what types of playersare in the group, you can ask each player any or allof the following questions:• Which of the three pillars of adventuring (combat,exploration, roleplaying) interest you the most?• How much humor do you like in the game?• What level of technology do you prefer?• Do you enjoy solving in-game puzzles and riddles?• Do you like to track experience points, or wouldyou rather have your character advance in levelwhen I tell you to?HOUSE RULESHouse rules include optional rules, such as thosepresented in chapter 9 of the Dungeon Master'sGuide, and rules you create. If you plan to use anyhouse rules, session zero is a good time to discussthose rules with the players and solicit their input.House rules are best presented as experiments,and time will tell if they're good for your game. Ifyou introduce a house rule in session zero thatturns out to have an adverse effect on people's enjoyment of the game, you may jettison or revise thehouse rule to create a better gaming experience foreveryone. Don't feel bad if a house rule doesn't endup working as well as you expected it to. Remember:the goal is to ensure everyone is having fun.C H A P T E R 4 I D U N G E O N M A S T E R ' S TOOLSS I D E K I C K SMy \oolo'l-to-be 1idekick co1Ald leArlo'I A thi""' or two·froMAll thil-More MAteriAI for Project /11AMblekAilo'lelo'\. 'TA�HA'This section provides a straightforward way to adda special NPC-called a sidekick-to the group ofadventurers. These rules take a creature with a lowchallenge rating and give it levels in one of threesimple classes: Expert, Spellcaster, or Warrior.A sidekick can be incorporated into a group atthe party's inception, or a sidekick might join themduring the campaign. For example, the charactersmight meet a villager, an animal, or another creature, forge a friendship, and invite the creature tojoin them on their adventures.You can also use these rules to customize a monster for your own use as DM.CREATING A SIDEKICKA sidekick can be any type of creature with a statblock in the Monster Manual or another D&D book,but the challenge rating in its stat block must be 1/2or lower. You take that stat block and add to it, as explained in the "Gaining a Sidekick Class" section.To join the adventurers, the sidekick must be thefriend of at least one of them. This friendship mightbe connected to a character's backstory or to eventsthat have transpired in play. For example, a sidekickcould be a childhood friend or pet, or it might be acreature the adventurers saved. As DM, you determine whether there is sufficient trust established forthe creature to join the group.You decide who plays the sidekick. Here aresome options:• A player plays the sidekick as their second character-ideal when you have only one or two players.• A player plays the sidekick as their only character-ideal for a player who wants a characterwho's simpler than a typical player character.• The players jointly play the sidekick.• You play the sidekick.There's no limit on the number of sidekicks in agroup, but having more than one per player character can noticeably slow down the game. And whenestimating the difficulty of an upcoming encounter,count each sidekick as a character.GAINING A SIDEKICK CLASSWhen you create a sidekick, you choose the classit will have for the rest of its career: Expert, Spellcaster, or Warrior, each of which is detailed below.If a sidekick class contains a choice, you may makethe choice or let the players make it.1 4 2 C H A PT E R 4 I D U N G E O N M ASTE R ' S TOOLSSTARTING LEVELThe starting level of a sidekick is the same as theaverage level of the group.

To determine the amount of the increase, roll the Hit Die(the type of die appears in the sidekick's stat block),and add its Constitution modifier.

Rare specimens develop a deeper understanding of the world and can communicate withother creatures. In extremely rare cases, groups ofthese creatures band together, creating colonies.These bonded mimics cooperate to create largerobjects than any lone mimic could approximate. Amimic colony can work together to form buildings,bridges, crystal formations, cliff faces, statues, andnearly anything it desires. Entire villages appearingout of nowhere might be composed of mimics!Mimic Communication. Members of the colonydevelop telepathy and the ability to speak. Whilewithin 10 miles of the colony, any mimic can communicate telepathically with other creatures within1 20 feet of it and can speak Common and Undercommon fluently (or two other languages of theDM's choice). The colony's offspring gain these abilities innately and can use them even away from thecolony, as shown in the juvenile Mimic stat block.Confronting a Colony. A mimic colony's primarygoal is survival: If threatened by a force the mimicscan't overcome, they are willing to bargain. Mimiccolonies have learned that adventurers they can't defeat can be bought off with information about nearbycreatures or locations, hidden treasure (which thecolony obtained from prior "food"), or even one oftheir own young.JUVENILE MIMICTiny monstrosity (shapechanger)Armor Class 1 1Hit Points 7 (2d4 + 2)Speed 10 ft., climb 10 ft.STRl (-5)DEX12 (+l)Skills Stealth +3CON13 (+l )Damage Immunities acidCondition Immunities proneINT1 0 (+O)WIS13 (+l)CHA10 (+0)Senses darkvision 60 ft., Passive Perception 1 1Languages Common, U ndercommon, telepathy 120 ft.Challenge 0 (l 0 XP) Proficiency Bonus +2False Appearance (Object Form Only).

If a target fails the save by 5 or more, it isrestrained instead for that duration.• The mimic colony uses the Help action, aiding acreature of its choice within 300 feet of it.• The mimic colony chooses up to three creatureswithin 300 feet of it. Each target must succeed ona DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (3d8)acid damage, as orifices appear on surfaces in theenvironment and launch caustic spittle.• The mimic colony chooses a cube of nonmagical,inanimate material in physical contact with it. Thecube can be up to 1 5 feet on a side. The colony reshapes that material however it likes. This transformation lasts for 1 hour.When determining the difficulty of an encounterwith a hostile mimic colony, consider the colony tobe one additional creature of challenge rating 2.1 6 8 C HA P T E R 4 I D U N G E O N M A ST E R ' S TOOLSPRIMAL FRUITIn wild places brimming with nature's power, gardens meticulously tended by eccentric wizards, andblessed groves touched by divine providence, plantscan sometimes produce fruit bursting with primalmagic. Not every fruit-bearing plant holds thisstored magic, but those that do bear obvious signs:their colors are more vibrant or shift randomly, theirskin sparkles in the light or glows in the dark, softhums emanate from them, or they feel peculiar tothe touch.A fruit-bearing plant that is suffused with magicmight produce ld6 pieces of primal fruit everyweek. Primal fruit remains potent for 1 week,after which it loses its magical properties but remains edible.As an action, a creature can eat a piece of primalfruit to gain its effects. This fruit can be squeezedinto juice or cooked into a dish and retains itsmagic. Choose an effect or roll on the Primal FruitEffects table to determine what happens when apiece of the fruit is consumed. An identify spell orsimilar magic reveals the beneficial effect of a pieceof fruit before it is eaten, but it doesn't reveal a curseor side effect.P R I M A L F R U I T EFFECTSd8 EffectThe creature rega i n s 3d8 + 4 hit points, a n d itsskin sheds bright l ight in a 5 -foot rad ius and d i ml ight for a n additional 5 feet for l hour2 The creature feels a s u rge of m ight.

The greatest of these magical streams are persistent paths, often known bycolloquial names or simply as unearthly roads. Anunearthly road acts like a sort of planar portal thatstretches from one place to another, be they sites onthe same world or on different planes of existence.Unearthly roads allow creatures to cross great dis-tances rapidly, moving from an entrance gate to anexit gate or visa versa. These paths operate like longtunnels, and a creature that travels on an unearthlyroad progresses 2 1 miles of distance in the time itwould normally take it to travel 1 mile. While on theroad, glimpses of the world beyond might be visiblein blurred or distorted visions of scenery or especially prominent landmarks. Creatures or specificdetails are not visible beyond an unearthly road.Some unearthly roads serve as trade routes or secret connections between distant lands. Others shiftlocations at noteworthy times or in response to external phenomena, like on specific anniversaries orin response to the phases of the moon. Some mightalso require a particular item, ritual, or action toopen their gates. The Unearthly Road Keys table offers suggestions on how to enter an unearthly road.U N EART H LY ROAD KEYSd6 Keyl Throwi n g a silver orb through an ancient arch2 S p i l l i n g a pint of h u manoid blood3 Calling the name of a specific archfey three times4 Weari n g the regalia of a lost royal dynasty5 Permanently sacrificing a memory of joy6 Being the descendant of a legendary heroNATURAL HAZARDSEven without the threats of supernatural environments, the world is a dangerous place. The following natural hazards expand on those presented inthe Dungeon Masters Guide.AVALANCHESA typical avalanche (or rockslide) i s 300 feet wide,1 50 feet long, and 30 feet thick. Creatures in thepath of an avalanche can avoid it or escape it ifthey're close to its edge, but outrunning one is almost impossible.When an avalanche occurs, all nearby creaturesmust roll initiative. Twice each round, on initiativecounts 10 and 0, the avalanche travels 300 feet untilit can travel no more. When an avalanche moves,any creature in its space moves along with it andfalls prone, and the creature must make a DC 1 5Strength saving throw, taking ldlO bludgeoningdamage on a failed save, or half as much damage ona successful one.When an avalanche stops, the snow and otherdebris settle and bury creatures. A creature buriedin this way is blinded and restrained, and it has totalcover. The creature gains 1 level of exhaustion forevery 5 minutes it spends buried. It can try to dig itself free as an action, breaking the surface and ending the blinded and restrained conditions on itselfC H A PT E R 4 I D U N G E O N M A S T E R ' S TOOLS 1 6 9with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.A creature that fails this check three times can't attempt to dig itself out again.A creature that is not restrained or incapacitatedcan spend 1 minute freeing a buried creature. Oncefree, that creature is no longer blinded or restrainedby the avalanche.FALLING INTO WATERA creature that falls into water or another liquid canuse its reaction to make a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to hit the surfacehead or feet first. On a successful check, any damage resulting from the fall is halved.FALLING ONTO A C REATUREIf a creature falls into the space of a second creatureand neither of them is Tiny, the second creaturemust succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw orbe impacted by the falling creature, and any damageresulting from the fall is divided evenly betweenthem. The impacted creature is also knocked prone,unless it is two or more sizes larger than the falling creature.SPELL EQUIVALENTS OF NATURAL HAZARDSNumerous spells emulate the wrath of nature, andyou can use spell effects to represent a variety ofnatural hazards.

This section presents a selection of puzzles designed to invite group participation and challengeadventurers of any stripe-from genius scholars tomartial masters. Each puzzle is flexible enough tobe included in your campaign as presented or customized to fit the needs of a specific adventure.WHY USE P U Z ZLES?Puzzles provide exciting opportunities to use wit toovercome obstacles and allow characters to collaborate to make discoveries. You might add a puzzle toan adventure for any of the following reasons:• To encourage a party to discover informationthrough teamwork• To provide an opportunity for characters to usetheir skills in uncommon ways• To make a setting feel more whimsical, mysterious, or otherworldly• To explain why no one has ever discovered something hidden close at hand• To reveal a secret no one knows and magiccan't revealSome puzzles can take considerable time to solve,so be mindful of how often you use them in your adventures. Remember, most puzzles don't need to besolved immediately, and they might be all the moresatisfying if their riddles linger unresolved for multiple sessions.PUZ ZLE ELEMENTSText that a ppears i n a box l i ke this is meant to be readaloud or paraph rased for the p l ayers when their characters fi rst a rrive i n a location with a p uzzle or whenotherwise noted.Additionally, the following sections appear ineach puzzle:Difficulty. Each puzzle is classified as easy, medium, or hard. The harder the puzzle, the morelikely the players will need hints to solve it.Puzzle Features. This section presents an overviewof the puzzle's features and how they can be interacted with.Solution. This section explains how the puzzleis solved.Hint Checks. This section suggests hints that characters might use their skills to reveal. Provide oneor more of the hints if the characters get stuck. Ifa character has proficiency in a hint's associatedskill, give them that hint if they ask you for help.Customizing the Puzzle. This section explores howto integrate the puzzle into your adventures, alterits difficulty, or make other adjustments.H INTSIf players request a hint while attempting to solvea puzzle, consult that puzzle's "Hint Checks" section. Each hint is associated with a skill and a DC.If a character in the party has proficiency in a skillrelated to a hint, share that hint with them. If thesame skill is listed multiple times with the same orhigher DCs, reveal hints with the lowest DCs firstthen hints with higher DCs if the group requestsadditional help.If no character has proficiency in any of the listedskills, characters can make ability checks usingthe listed skills and DCs. Those who succeed on acheck learn the associated hint .Don't hesitate to reveal hints to the party. Hintsprovide characters with relevant skills the opportunity to shine, even if they're not usually particularlycunning. Additionally, if party members have backgrounds or campaign experiences that might tie intoa puzzle, those make great reasons to provide characters with additional hints.RUNNING PUZ ZLESOnce you've presented a puzzle to a group, feel freeto add and clarify details as you would in any othertype of encounter. Try not to give away details of thepuzzle's solution in your descriptions, but there'snothing wrong with letting a hint slip here or there.Don't worry whether it's a player or a characterwho's solving a puzzle. While hint checks providea way for character experience to contribute to apuzzle's solution, ultimately the boundaries betweena player's and a character's ability to solve a puzzleisn't as important as the group enjoying the challenge. However, if a player knows the answer to apuzzle in advance, urge them to share only hintstheir character learns.After presenting a puzzle, encourage the partyto solve it together, to pool hints, and to share theirinsights. Work with the group to share any puzzlehandouts and to take turns talking through theirthoughts. Ultimately, solving a puzzle will be a victory for the whole group, not one individual.C H A P T E R 4 I D U NGEON M AST E R' S TOOLS 1 7 1172C REATU R E PAI NTINGSDifficulty: EasyThis short puzzle works anywhere that makes sensefor characters to peruse several paintings, such asin a museum or manor. These paintings could evenappear in a sketchbook found in a dusty old drawer.This counting puzzle leads to a name of a creature.Fit this into your campaign by making the nameof the creature the first item on a scavenger hunt orthe first clue in a larger mystery.This gallery is decorated with seven framed pai ntingsof creatures.

This room is dedicated to the d efeat of a l l monsters with in."Characters should be free to explore the gallery andinspect the paintings and dedication to discover theparts of the puzzle.PU Z ZLE FEATURESThere are seven paintings on the walls. The paintings feature a gruesome werewolf under a fullmoon, a trio of gnolls fighting over a spear, a grinning beholder, two trolls sitting under a tree, fivekobolds around a bonfire, two gelatinous cubespatrolling a dungeon corridor, and three dragonsin flight.SOLUTIONEach painting features a number of creatures ofa particular kind, as summarized in the CreaturePaintings table. Counting into each creature's nameby the number of creatures in the painting reveals aletter. When unscrambled, the letters spell out "owlbear." Characters are likely to reveal these letters inrandom order.

It might also be a clue that points toa hidden treasure. For example, there might be astuffed owlbear in another room that has treasurehidden inside it.H INT CHECKSAny character has the option of making these abilitychecks to receive a hint:Intelligence (Investigation) DC 10. The charac-ter deduces that the number of creatures in apainting is important and uses that number todetermine which letter of the creature's name theyshould review.Wisdom (Perception) DC 10. When looking at thededication, the words "count on" alert the character that they should count the creatures.CUSTOMIZING THE PUZ ZLEYou can replace the monsters in the artwork withdistinctive objects, members of obvious professions,and anything else that might logically be in a group.Then, follow the letter-counting method detailed inthis puzzle to determine how many subjects shouldfeature in each piece of art."'<�015::>:suR E C KLE S S STE P SDifficulty: EasyThis puzzle features a word search on floor tiles,which might present a barrier to exploration inmyriad scenarios. To cross safely, characters mustfirst uncover what words they're searching for andthen find them in the tiles.You ·enter a cobweb-fil led room lit by torches on opposite walls. D ust o n the floor has collected i n groovesthat cover rows of five-foot-squa re tiles. On the opposite wall, a sol itary a rch leads from the room . One wallbears the fo l l owing i nscri ption:Eight appear before your eyes,And eight remain in schooled disguise.Avoid all magic in this room,Lest reckless steps ensure your doom.The tiles covering the floor of this room each bear asingle letter written in the Common alphabet, making the room a giant word search. Traps beneathmany of the tiles threaten those who move throughthe room heedless of the hidden words.PUZ ZLE FEATURESThe floor of this 60-foot-by-70-foot room is madeof 5-foot-square stone tiles laid out in a grid. Eachtile has a letter chiseled into it, as shown in puzzlehandout 1 at the end of this chapter. Place a copy ofthe handout for this puzzle on the table, and allowplayers to use miniatures to show how their characters navigate the room.To safely walk across the room, a character muststep on the correct tiles. Stepping on an incorrecttile sets off a trap.TRAPSCertain tiles (as indicated in this trap's "Solution"section) are trapped. A trapped tile is triggeredwhen more than 20 pounds of weight are placedon it, activating the pressure plate underneath andcausing jets of poisonous gas to spout from thecracks between the tiles. Any creature above thetrapped floor tile or one of its adjacent tiles mustmake a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 1 1(2d 10) poison damage on a failed save, or half asmuch damage on a successful one.As an action, a character can disable a trap witha successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves'tools. If a character fails to disable the trap, the tile'strap can no longer be disabled.Characters can attempt to jump over trapped tiles,using the jump rules in the Player's Handbook.SOLUTIONThe only safe tiles for characters to step on are theones with the faded black letters in diagram 4. 1 .Red letters spell out either "magic" or one o f theschools of magic: abjuration, conjuration, divination,enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, andtransmutation. Stepping on one of these tiles triggers a poison trap, as described earlier.H INT CHECKSAny character has the option of making these abilitychecks to receive a hint:Intelligence (Arcana) DC 10. The character seesone instance of a school of magic on the floor.Intelligence (Investigation) DC 10. The characterinterprets the clue in the wall verse: there areeight schools of magic.Wisdom (Perception) DC 10. Each character whosucceeds on this check sees an instance of theword "magic" in the floor.CUSTOMIZING THE PUZZLEConsider using this puzzle's structure to create anynumber of thematic word searches hiding deadlytraps. Once you've created a hint suggesting whattypes of words to look for, it's a simple matter to create your own grid of hidden words.RAISING THE D IFFICULTYYou can increase this puzzle's difficulty by changingthe word search's letters to use another alphabet,such as those presented in the Player's Handbook.Alternatively, you can create an entirely new code toreplace the letters, requiring the characters to find acipher to reveal the tiles' meanings before they canundertake the puzzle and cross the room safely.You can also increase the difficulty by introducingtrap variants, as described below.TRAP VARIANTSRather than have the same poison gas trap on everytrapped tile, each word can have a distinct trap associated with it, as described below:Magic. The trap triggers normally, as described inthis puzzle's "Traps" section.Abjuration. The trap casts dispel magic on eachcreature in the room, using a 9th-level spell slot.Conjuration. The trap teleports the creature thattriggered it back to the entrance of the room. Thatcreature must also make a DC 15 Constitutionsaving throw, taking 1 1 (2d 10) force damage ona failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.Divination.

A playerwhose character is affected by this trap should notbe allowed to reference the accompanying playerhandout until the effect on that character ends.Enchantment. The trap casts suggestion (save DC1 5) on the creature that triggered it. On a failedsave, a gentle voice only the creature can hear tellsit to move 5 feet in a random direction. This movement might cause it to trigger another trap.Evocation. Magical fire erupts from the trapped tile.The creature that triggered this trap must succeed on a DC 1 5 Dexterity saving throw, taking1 1 (2d 10) fire damage on a failed save, or half asmuch damage on a successful one.Illusion. A suit of animated armor appears in anunoccupied space within 5 feet of the creaturethat set off this trap. The armor attacks only thecreature that summoned it and can't leave theroom. It doesn't set off any of the room's traps anddisappears if it takes any damage. Otherwise, itlasts for 1 minute.Necromancy. Any creature that triggers this traphears a banshee's wail in its mind. Unless thecreature is a construct or undead, it must succeedon a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature drops to 0 hit points. On a success, it takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage.Transmutation. The trap casts polymorph (save DC1 5) on the creature that triggered it. On a failedsave, the creature turns into a giant frog.�20a":'ivS K E LETON KEYSDifficulty: EasyThis puzzle presents a quick encounter useful forproviding treasure or information. It features a boxwith four locks. ·You come upon a sinister m etal box with an i ro n lockb u i lt i nto each of its fou r sides. Each lock s ports akeyhole with a sculpted i mage a bove it. Fou r i ron keyshang from hooks on a n earby wa l l , a n d each key has ad ifferent n u mber of teeth. Above the keys, the fol l owing verse has been etched i nto the wall:The spells on these locks are all the same.Though each possesses a unique name.Count on your answer to unlock the way,But use the wrong key to your dismay.All four locks must be opened before the box's contents (whatever they might be) can be accessed.PU ZZLE FEATURESShow the players puzzle handout 2 (see the end ofthis chapter) when their characters examine thekeys. Each key has a different number of teeth: six,five, four, and three, respectively.Each lock has a creature molded in iron above it: abat, snake, spider, or wolf, respectively. These lockscan't be picked. If anything other than the correctkey is placed inside a lock, creatures correspondingto the image above the lock (ld4 giant bats, ld4giant poisonous snakes, ld4 giant wolf spiders,or ld4 wolves) are summoned into the room. Eachsummoned creature is hostile and disappears after10 minutes or when reduced to 0 hit points. Thesebeasts can't be charmed or frightened.SOLUTIONOnce the characters identify the creature depictedabove each lock, they should count the letters ineach creature's name. The number of letters in acreature's name corresponds to the number of teethon the correct key, as shown in the Skeleton KeysSolution table.S K E L ETO N KEYS SO LUTI O NLock KeyBat Three teethS nake Five teethSpider Six teethWolf Fou r teethH INT CHECKSAny character has the option of making these abilitychecks to receive a hint:Intelligence (Nature) DC 10. The character knowsthat "natural" knowledge about bats, snakes, spiders, and wolves in general won't help here.Wisdom (Perception) DC 10. The character realizes that the keys' skull-shaped heads are all thesame and probably have no bearing on the puzzle's solution.CUSTOMIZING THE PUZ ZLEThe focal parts of this puzzle are the locks and keys,not the chest. You could easily convert this puzzleto feature any types of locks, be they on doors, cells,books, or some more esoteric barrier.Beyond the form the locks and keys take, youmight also consider adjusting the creatures depictedwith each lock to suit your adventures. Just keepin mind that the number of teeth on each key mustmatch the number of letters in your substitutions,and those substitutions should be things the characters can identify.RAISING THE D IFFICULTYRather than associating each lock with a particularimage of a creature, consider presenting a riddlealongside each lock. The answer to each riddleshould be the related creature's name, allowingcharacters to match the riddles' answers to theproper keys.C H A P T E R 4 J D U N G E O N M A ST E R ' S TOOLS 175ALL THAT GLITT E R SDifficulty: MediumThis gem-filled room can be placed in any dungeon,estate, or building with multiple rooms and mightserve as both a tr<lp and a place to obtain a reward.Dozens of gems lie strewn u pon the floor. Amid thetreas u re stands a m arble statue with its hands claspedin front of it. A p l acard at the statue's base reads,"Only one treas u re may l eave this room. Cross witha nother and find you r tomb."PUZ ZLE FEATURESThe statue, which is impervious to damage, depictsIoun or some other god of knowledge or order.Any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) check can identify the figure being depicted.D IAMONDBetween the palms of the statue's clasped hands isa diamond, which can only be found and retrievedonce the puzzle is solved. Once the characters solvethe puzzle, the statue's hands open, allowing thediamond to be taken. Upon breaching the thresholdof the room with the diamond, a trapped soul inthe form of a friendly, thankful spirit is released.The spirit leaves to pursue its own goals, and thediamond is left behind as a reward. The diamond isworth 5,000 gp.GEMSTONE SA n inventory of the room reveals the following gemstones scattered across the floor: eighteen pieces ofjade, sixteen onyxes, fourteen amethysts, thirteensapphires, twelve rubies, nine pieces of amber, eightcitrines, five garnets, and one piece of quartz.If a creature attempts to leave the room with anyof these stones, the gem disappears and an angryspirit trapped inside it is released. The spirit manifests as a hostile undead creature of your choice,such as a ghost, specter, or skeleton. When thiscreature is reduced to 0 hit points, its form dissipates, leaving no trace of itself behind.NAMED SPI RITSCharacters hear each spirit whisper its name beforeit dissipates. The �ames themselves are not important, other than they must start with the appropriateletter of the alphabet.The following list provides names for all the imprisoned spirits, each name starting with the letterassociated with the spirit's gemstone prison:1 7 6 C H A PT E R 4 I D U N G E O N M ASTER'S TOOLSA S P I R I T E S C A P E SA G E M S T O N E .Quartz.

For example, thereis one piece of quartz, so "quartz" corresponds tothe first letter of the alphabet (A), while there arefourteen amethysts, so "amethyst" corresponds tothe fourteenth letter of the alphabet (N).G E M I N VE N TO RYGem Amount LetterAmber 9Amethyst 1 4 NCitri ne 8 HGarnet 5 EJade 1 8 ROnyx 1 6 pQua rtz AR u by 1 2 LSapphire 1 3 MOnce the gems are sorted by type and alphabetized, characters can count into the alphabet by howmany of each are in the room to reveal the words"in her palm." When a character speaks this phrasealoud, the statue's folded hands open, revealing thepreviously hidden diamond.HINT CHECKSAny character has the option of making these abilitychecks to receive a hint:Intelligence (Arcana) DC 1 5. The character candetermine that there are spirits i mprisoned in thegemstones scattered on the floor.Intelligence (Religion) DC 10. The characterknows that the statue represents a god of knowledge and order, and the character has a strongfeeling that the order of the gems in the room isimportant.Wisdom (Insight) DC 10. The character senses thatthe number of each type of gem isn't arbitrary.CUSTOMIZING THE PU ZZLEThis puzzle explores how to use groups of objectsto disguise a message. So long as your groups canbe arranged in a logical order (like the gems beingarranged alphabetically in this puzzle), all you mustdo is adjust the number of items to correspond toa particular letter of the alphabet. Alternatively,perhaps another organizing principle orders yourgroups. For example, tombstones that feature varying numbers of skulls might be arranged by dates,while stacks of books might be ordered by sharedpage-counts. These details can be easy to miss,though, so make sure you present a riddle or othersignpost to make sure your players notice there's apuzzle at hand.LOWERING THE D IFFICULTYTo make the puzzle easier to solve, a spirit can provide a hint in addition to giving its name. Coaxing ahint from a spirit requires a successful DC 1 5 Charisma (Persuasion or Intimidation) check. Considerhints like "A is the fi rst letter in the alphabet" and"The gemstones, in order, will help for a spell."RELEASING THE SPIRITSIf the characters don't attempt to remove gems fromthe room, or if they spend too long deliberating, create a new trigger to release the spirits. For example,perhaps a spirit is released if a character places agem near the statue or if it's held for too long.EYE OF TH E B EHOLD E RDifficulty: MediumThis map puzzle is designed to lead a party througha dungeon where a roaming beholder doesn't wishto be disturbed. A series of clues tie to the word"eye," and the characters must determine how to getthrough the area safely.A d isorienti n g wave sweeps over you .

Igor'slantern emits light in a 5-foot radius, but only solong as the gobl in holds it. The lantern goes dark ifany other creature takes custody of it.PU ZZLE FEATURESThe magical maze the characters find themselves inis comprised of an endless series of identical chambers. Each chamber has four passages, one at eachcardinal direction. The gobJin guide poses riddlesthat can lead the party along the path that ultimatelyC H A PT E R 4 I D U N G E O N M A S T E R ' S TOOLSexits the maze. Each time the party moves throughthe correct passage and enters a new room, the goblin provides them with a new riddle that hints whichdirection to travel in next. If they make an error,the characters encounter a monster of your choiceand then must backtrack from their last correctturn. After three wrong turns, the party encountersthe beholder.HALLWAYSThe halls of this maze are 60 feet long and 10 feetwide. If the characters move away from the guideduring combat or for any other reason, the goblinencourages them to follow him back to the last correct turn.THE GOBLIN'S RIDDLESUpon meeting the characters (and to discouragethem from attacking), the goblin makes it clearthere is no way out of the maze without his help.Characters can determine that the goblin is sincerein wanting to help with a successful DC 10 Wisdom(Insight) check.1 7 8 C H A PT E R 4 I D U N GEON M A ST E R ' S TOOLSOnce the goblin has the characters' attention, itprovides the first riddle, then waits for the party toventure down a passage of its choice. The goblinstops at each intersection and either provides thenext riddle (if the party chose the correct path) oravoids the monster the group encounters (if theparty chose the incorrect path), leading the characters back to the last correct chamber along the pathafter any battle.The goblin's riddles (and their answers) areas follows:• What beast has the sharpest eye? (Eagle)• Threads get pulled through the eye ofwhat? (Needle)• What is the eye to the soul? (Window)• Whose eye matters to a witch's brew? (Newt)• This eye curses you with misfortune. (Evil)• This eye brings a temporary calm. (Storm)• Roll a one on a six-sided die. Roll another and getthe same. Take both together, and what's theirname? (Snake eyes)SOLUTIONThe answer to each riddle begins with a letter indicating the direction of the path the charactersshould follow next. The path provided by the riddles'answers takes the following route: east, north, west,north, east, south, south. This path leads the characters through some chambers more than once, whichis a necessary part of the magic that will allow themto escape.H INT CHE CKSAny character has the option of making these abilitychecks to receive a hint:Charisma (Persuasion) DC 15.

By crafting di rectionsthat suit locations in your campaign's' setting, youcan create a puzzle that's integrated into you r adventure's plot, using a map the characters might alreadypossess. Your version of the puzzle can add as manydigits and directions as you see fit, or it might revealletters, symbols, or short words, depending on thecomplexity of your design.RAISING THE DIFFICULTYYou can increase this puzzle's chal lenge by dividingthe map into pieces that need to be separately discovered, or the characters might need to learn thedirections from someone who personally exploredthe island. As long as the order of locations doesn'tchange, the code remains correct.MATERIAL C OM P O N E NT SDifficulty: MediumThis puzzle might appear in a wizard's workshop,study, or spellbook. The solution leads to a password that reveals new or rare spells (such as thosein chapter 3). Alternatively, the password can beused for any other function that fits with your story.You fi n d a n old piece of paper beari n g a l ist of spellsa n d com ponents.

If the puzzle is giving them grief, theycan take the parchment with them and fi nd otherswho can help them solve it.BOOKCASESAll around the wizard's study are shelves and casesfilled with books, scrolls, and other supplies. A character who makes a successful DC 12 Intelligence(Arcana) check notices a spell component with nogp value from the list (such as a chip of mica or a bitof bat fur).LISTSThe parchment has a list of spells and a list ofmaterial components. However, the components tothe right don't match with the adjacent spells to theleft. The parchment itself doesn't have any magicalqualities, but the word it reveals potentially does.Wizards and other spellcasters can identify thecorrect spell components for any spell they know,but they must succeed on the I ntelligence (Arcana)checks noted in the "Hint Checks" section below torecall the correct material components for any lessfamiliar spells.SOLUTIONDrawing a line from a spell to its material component crosses out letters that fall between thecolumns, as shown in diagram 4.4. Once all spellsare connected to components, the untouched lettersspell out "presto," which, when said aloud with thepaper in hand, causes one or more spell scrolls(or some other treasure of your choice) to magically appear.C H A PT E R 4 I D U N G E O N M A S T E R ' S TOOLS 1 8 1H INT CHECKSAny character has the option of making these abilitychecks to receive a hint:Intelligence (Arcana) DC 10.

The character noticesthat straight lines drawn between spells and material components cross through some of the lettersin the center.CUSTOMI Z ING THE PU ZZLEWhile spells and components make easy to associate lists, you might also consider creating your ownversion of this puzzle using paired sets of monstersand creature types, planes of existence and theirnative inhabitants, famous figures in a setting andtheir homelands, and so forth.LOWERING THE D IFFICULTYIf your party doesn't include characters with considerable magical expertise, consider adding art tothe room's walls or on decorative book covers thatreveal connections between the listed spells andcomponents. These images might give away a fewconnections between the lists or lower the DCs ofthe puzzle's hint checks.RAISING THE DIFFICULTYRather than using common spells the charactersmight be familiar with, a more challenging versionof this puzzle might feature lost spells or other lorethe party has no way of knowing. Only by consultingexperts, undertaking research, or further adventuring might the party reveal the connections betweenthe two lists.M E M B E RS O N LYDifficulty: MediumA secret club, cultist meeting, or thieves' guild requires a password to enter. In this puzzle, thosewho guard a certain door are so secretive that theychange the password constantly, fearing someonemight have infiltrated their members' ranks.You watch a figure a p p roach an oak door with a slidewindow. The figure knocks, and a guard opens thewi ndow and says, " S ix." The figure replies, "Three."The guard then opens the door, a l lowi ng the fi g u reto enter.1 8 2 C H A P T E R 4 I D U N G E O N M A ST E R ' S TOOLSThis building seems to have only one entrance: theoak door with a small slide window. A guard opensthe window and speaks a seemingly random number to anyone who knocks on the door.PU ZZLE FEATURESEven after observing the building from all angles,characters only see members entering through theone door after speaking to the guard.DOORThe door is made o f oak reinforced with 3-ioch-wideiron bars. Three deadbolts secure the door, whichis also barred from the inside, so there are no locksthat can be picked from the outside.GUARDA guard stands on the other side of the door aroundthe clock, and the only way to speak with the guardis through the door's slide window. The guard canbe any sort of talking creature, such as an assassin,a cult fanatic, or a thug. More monstrous optionsinclude a bugbear, wereboar, or nycaloth.If a character knocks on the door, the guard slidesopen the window and gruffly gives a number, expecting the proper response. The guard gives a differentnumber each time someone knocks. Any properresponse grants a single character entry, and theguard only allows one member to enter at a time.Characters who provide incorrect answers andattempt to enter again must disguise themselvesin some way or be refused entry. The guard onlywillingly opens the door for someone who speaksthe correct password. The guard raises the alarm ifunauthorized people try to open or bypass the door,calling six more guards to help defend the entrance.MEMBERSIf the characters continue watching the door, theysee up to four more visitors approach it. To eavesdrop on each exchange, the characters must succeed on a DC 1 2 group Dexterity (Stealth) check toremain hidden; if the group check fails, the visitornotices they're being observed and speaks quietlyenough that their answer can't be overheard.Second Visitor. The guard opens the window andsays, "Twelve." The visitor responds with "Six"and is allowed inside.Third Visitor. The guard opens the window andsays, "Teo." The visitor responds with "Five" andis turned away.Fourth Visitor. The guard opens the window andsays, "Seven." The visitor responds with "Five"and is allowed inside.Fifth Visitor. The guard opens the window andsays, "Zero." The visitor responds with "One" andis turned away.SOLUTIONEach member that approaches the door is givena number by the guard. There is no mathematicalequation here; the only valid response to a numbergiven by the guan;:I is the number of letters in theguard's number.For example, one member was given the number"six." There are three letters in the word "six," sothe password for that member is "three."

The characterdeduces there is no mathematical equation thatconnects the numbers exchanged between theguard and visitors.Wisdom (Insight) DC 15. The character suspectsthat the answer has to do with the word, notthe number.CUSTOMIZING THE PUZZLEPart of what makes this puzzle challenging is that itmisleads players into thinking they're overhearinga mathematical equation. To figure out the solution,they have to first overcome their own assumptions.An easier version of this puzzle might involvecounting the letters in any type of word the guardprovides and responding with that number. Alternatively, the response to the guard's number mightbe any word with the same number of letters as thatnumber-for example, "five" has four letters, making"duck" or "smog" suitable responses. The more yourpuzzle plays with numbers as words rather than digits, the more challenging it's likely to be.E XACT C H A NGEDifficulty: HardThis puzzle provides an elaborate, coin-based lockto any sort of door, vault, or other barrier.The door here is locked a n d has no handle.

Four of the wal ls are covered i n mosaics,each d epicting the destructive force of one of the foure le me nts.

It can be opened only by completing this puzzle, and there are no other exits.PUZ ZLE FEATURESThe mosaics, statues, and tiles are described belowin greater detail.MOSAIC SThe four wall mosaics depict the following:• A water elemental crashes through a city wall in ahuge wave. In the center of the image is a trianglepointing downward.• An earth elemental looms over a group of warriors. A triangle pointing downward with a horizontal line through it is carved into its chest.• A fire elemental burns through a forest town.In the center of the flames is a triangle pointing upward.• An air elemental gusts through a stormy sky.Within the clouds is a triangle pointing upwardwith a line running horizontally through it.STATUESThe statues are actual elementals magically boundin stone. The magic that turned these elementalsinto statues is slowly coming undone, as the tile pattern that binds them has fallen apart.TILESIf the characters don't replace the four fallen tiles intheir proper sequence, all four statues revert to theirtrue forms at the same time and attack the characters. The exact timing of this event is left to you, butthe characters should be given enough time to takea crack at solving the puzzle. The characters canalso release the elementals individually by puttingtitles in the wrong order or orientation.Puzzle handout 6 (see the end of this chapter)illustrates the row of tiles set into the wall abovethe statues. Without a check, the characters realize that four of the tiles fell down when the doorslammed shut behind them. With a successful DC15 Intelligence (Arcana) check, a character can determine that these tiles are what keeps the elementals bound.If a tile is placed in the wrong place in the row,the corresponding elemental is freed from itsstone prison and attacks. Only one of each elemental appears:• If the improperly placed tile has an open trianglepointing downward, the water elemental is freed.• 1f the improperly placed tile has an open trianglepointing upward, the fire elemental is freed.• If the improperly placed tile has a triangle pointing upward with a horizontal line running throughit, the air elemental is freed.• If the improperly placed tile has a triangle pointing downward with a horizontal line runningthrough it, the earth elemental is freed.SOLUTIONThe correct, complete pattern is shown here:, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,L.9\7\l L.A. \l L.L. 9\7\l L.A.1 • • • · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · ·2 3 4 5 G 8 9 10 11 12 13 1 4The odd-numbered tiles form a recurring pattern of open triangles that alternate betweenpointing up and down.

Tiles 2 and 4 point downward, but the first ofthem has a line through the triangle. Tiles 6 and 8follow the same pattern, but the triangles point up.The pattern then repeats, with tiles 10 and 1 2 beingthe same as tiles 2 and 4 and tile 14 being the sameas tile 6.Solving the puzzle or defeating all four elementalscauses the door to the room to swing open.H INT CHECKSAny character has the option of making these abilitychecks to receive a hint:Intelligence (Investigation) DC 15.

The charactercan deduce which tiles correspond to whichelementals.CUSTOMIZ ING THE PU ZZLEInterweaving multiple patterns makes it easy todisguise them. With this in mind, you might use anygroup of symbols to create as elaborate a series ofpatterns as you please, then challenge players tofill in a missing segment. While the symbols in thispuzzle refer to the four elements, you might use holysymbols, colors, dolls on a shelf, or any other repeating design to convey your puzzle.When an elemental is defeated, it might leave behind a valuable gemstone , a map fragment, a clue tosome other puzzle, or something similar.RAISING THE DIFFICULTYTo increase the difficulty of this puzzle, enforce atime factor: perhaps one elemental breaks free atthe end of every five minutes of real time that passuntil the puzzle is solved.You can also raise the difficulty by having statuesdepict genies instead of elementals. In this case,replace the four elementals with a dao, a djinni, anefreeti, and a marid. These genies are compelled toattack the characters and can't be reasoned with.C H A P T E R 4 I DU NGEON M A ST E R ' S TOOLS 1 8 5H AU N T E D HALLWAYDifficulty: HardMany unquiet spirits linger in the world becausethey can't bare to leave something behind. In thispuzzle, finding the solution also means helping alost soul find peace.Six alcoves l i ne this h a l l , each one n u m bered fro m oneto six. O n the floor of each alcove, a lit candle gen-tly fl ickers.From the h a l l 's far end d rifts a low m oa n . There,barely visible, sobs the apparition of a small girl hovering over a d iscarded rag d o l l . " N ames, names,"she cries. "I can remember them a l l except theone I need."The spirit, Dolora, is a harmless apparition whowon't engage the party in combat. If threatened, shevanishes and reappears at the opposite end of thehall, sobbing anew.If approached with compassion, Dolora bemoansthe fact that she can't pick up her doll until shespeaks its name, which she has forgotten. She refuses to leave this place without the doll.Dolora, who only recalls fragmented memoriesof her life, can't answer many questions. This isparticularly true about the messages associated1 8 6 C H A PT E R 4 I D U N G E O N M A STER'S TOOLSwith the alcoves in the hall (see "Alcoves" laterin this section). While Dolora can't answer vaguequestions about the candles' clues (such as "Whois this talking about?"), she can provide the namesof specific people when prompted. For example, ifa character asks directly, "What was your mother'sname?" Dolora provides the correct response. Shealso spells out the name, which is a clue that thespelling is important.PUZZLE FEATURESDolora can't leave the hall and avoids the alcoves.ALCOVESThe hall i s lined with six alcoves, each one with aunique numeral between 1 and 6 carved above it. Averse scratched into the back wall of each alcove ismade visible by the candlelight. Each verse is presented below, accompanied by a parenthetical explanation that shouldn't be shared with the players ortheir characters:Verse 1. "Not his keeper, nor he mine; loved andhated at the same time." (This refers to Dolora'sbrother, whose name was Sam.)Verse 2. "My first vision: her hazel eyes. My firstsound: her lullabies." (This refers to Dolora'smother, whose name was Delia.)Verse 3. "Her lives she lost, all three by three, andthrough the dark this hunter sees." (This refers toDolora's cat, whose name was Fifi.)Verse 4. "Lines in his face of life lived long; storieswere his paternal song." (This refers to Dolora'sgrandfather, whose name was Tobias.)Verse 5. "Mentor and guide, her lessons learned.Knowledge measured by letters I earned."(This refers to Dolora's teacher, whose namewas Johana.)Verse 6. "Loved to eat hay, just as her friends did;Jived in one room with a shoat and a kid." (This refers to Dolora's horse, whose name was Alexia.)Each verse describes someone who was close toDolora. Once the characters determine who a verseis talking about, they may ask Dolora to providethe correct name. For example, "What is your cat'sname?" is a valid question for verse 3. The spiritthen answers, "Fifi," and she spells it aloud.CANDLESEach candle is a simple, 6-inch-tall wax taper. Whilein this hall, the candles never melt down and can'tbe extinguished.RAG D OLLIf the characters examine the rag doll or ask Doloraabout it, she imparts the following information:" M y d o l l knows a l l six-the fi rst for the fi rst, the second for the seco n d , the third for the third , the fo u rthfor the fourth, the fifth fo r the fifth, and the sixth forthe sixth."SOLUTIONOnce the characters learn all six names, they mustextrai::t one letter from each name, as noted in theRemembered Names table. An alcove's numberdetermines which letter to extract; for example,"Alexia" is the name connected to the verse in alcove 6, and the sixth Jetter in that name is A.R E M E M B E R E D N A M E SAlcove Name LetterS a m s2 Delia E3 Fifi F4 Tobias Is Johana N6 Alexia AThe doll's name is Sefina. Once Dolora is told this,she picks up the doll, speaks its name, and disappears with it, her spirit having been laid to rest. Ifthere's some piece of information you wish to havethe spirit reveal to the party, such as the location ofa nearby treasure or the secret of a more dangerousspirit, Dolora whispers this as she fades away.H INT CHECKSAny character has the option of making these abilitychecks to receive a hint:Charisma (Persuasion) DC 10.

The characterinterprets Dolora's cryptic clue about the doll asfollows: "all six" refers to the six letters of thedoll's name, which can be determined by gathering information from the verses in the six alcoves.WHAT 'S ON T H E M E N UDifficulty: HardThe characters discover that a popular local tavernis a front for a secret organization that they seekto join or infiltrate. The name of the tavern can bewhatever you want it to be. One suggestion is theCloak & Dagger.To get their foot in the proverbial door, the characters must speak the correct password to thetavern-keeper, Holda Heidrun. They can discoverthis password by solving a puzzle hidden in thetavern's menu.The tavern is crowded with h a p py people e njoyi n gtheir food a n d drin ks.

You see a copy of thetaver n 's m e n u on the table.Customize the tavern and flesh out its occupants asyou see fit.In addition to being the tavern-keeper, HoldaHeidrun is the keeper of many secrets. If the characters prod her for information, she asks for thepassword, and if the characters don't know it, shedivulges nothing of consequence.

Characters who solve the puzzle and succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check mightnotice another patron wearing a cloak pin shapedlike a chimera, or spot a shield emblazoned with achimera hanging on a wall that conceals a secretdoor. Only after speaking to the patron or seeingwhat's on the other side of the secret door do thecharacters obtain the actual password, which canbe anything you want.You can easily change "chimera" to somethingelse by swapping out menu items, choosing differentletters within the replacement items, and adjustingthe prices accordingly.LOWERING THE D IFFICULTYOther tavern patrons can provide additional hintsby talking among themselves in places where thecharacters can overhear them. A patron might saysomething like, "This inn keeps getting more expensive.

She might even recommend that the characters "start with the ale andcheese pastry, and continue on from there."u..iVI::J_J<(z0VIa::LUQa::0u�uCi:VII>-0..0u0f-0I0..20LUz<(a::uVIz0VIVI�a::LU0..PUZZLE HAND OUTSP U Z Z L E H A N D O U T 1 : R E C K L E S S S T E P SIcC H A PT E R 4 I D U N GE O N M A STE R' S TOOLS 1 8 9P U Z Z L E H A N D OU T 2 : S K E L E T O N K EY S/.P U Z Z L E H A N D OU T 3 : F O U R BY F O U R1 9 0 C H A PT E R 4 I DUNGEON M ASTER'S TOOLS.wVl::>-'<{z0Vl0::LU0..0::0u.LUlJ<{0..�II->--0..0u0I-0I0..0I-0LUI-z<{0::lJ�z0Vi�::::!- 0::LU0..P U Z Z L E H A N D O U T 4 : I L L U S I V E I S L A N DwVI:::>_J<(z0VI0::UJc..0::0u..UJlJ<(c..VIII->-c..0u0I-0Ic..0I-0UJ�I-z<(0::lJ�zQVI��0::UJc..C H A PT E R 4 I D U NGEON M A STE R' S TOOLSP U Z Z L E H A N D O U T 5 : M AT E R I AL C O M P O N E N T SMAGE AW.MOW • • !WONW . .
